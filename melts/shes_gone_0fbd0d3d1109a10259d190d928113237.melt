       G#            Cm  Fm            C#
       My woman is gone (my woman is gone)
       G#            Cm  Fm            C#
       My woman is gone (my woman is gone)

       G#            Cm       Fm            C#
       She had left me a note hanging on my door
       G#                      Cm                 Fm      C#
       She say she couldn't take it, she couldn't take anymore
       G#            Cm       Fm            C#
       The pressure around me just couldn't see
       G#              Cm          Fm           C#
       She felt like a prisoner who needs to be free
       G#              Cm     Fm           C#
       Fools have tried, yeah wisemen have failed
       G#               Cm     Fm                          C#
       Oh, listen to me honey, life could never be another jail
       G#       Cm                   Fm                C#
       Still we know now we'll never see smoke without fire
       G#       Cm          Fm          C#
       And everyone you see has a heart desire

                     G#                       Cm
               She's gone (she's gone), she's gone (she's gone)
                     Fm                       C#
               She's gone (she's gone), she's gone, yeah
               G#                       Cm
               Oh mockingbird, have you ever heard
               Fm                    C#
               Words that I never heard?
               Oh mockingbird, have you ever heard
               Words that I never heard?

       She made it through the exit (she just couldn't take it)
       She made it through the exit (she just couldn't make it)
       And, oh my children, if you see me cryin'
       My woman is gone
       If you see me - if you see me - if you see me
       If you see me cryin'
       If you see me - if you see me - if you see me
       If you see me cryin'

               She's gone (she's gone), she's gone (she's gone)
               she's gone (she's gone), she's gone, yeah
               Oh mockingbird, have you ever heard
               Words that I never heard?
               Oh mockingbird, have you ever heard
               Words that I never heard?
               She's gone (she's gone), she's gone (she's gone)
               She's gone...
