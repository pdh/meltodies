VERSE:
D5                      F         C
See the bluebird flyin' easy as a dream
Am7                        D5
dippin' and bobbin' in the sun
D5                     F            C
Could she be the one I saw so long ago
Am7                             D5
could she be the one to take me home

     D5                   C
This pasture is green I'm walking in the sun
     Am                                D5
It's turning brown I'm standing in the rain
   D5                   C
My overcoat is worn the pockets are all torn
    Am                   D5
I'm moving away from the pain

CHORUS:
C(v) D(vii)      Bb     C(v)     D(vii)
Tick tock    the clock  on   the wall
   F            C     D5
No wonder we're losin time

C(v) D(vii)   Bb  C(v)   D(vii)
Ring ring the old church bell
    F             C
The bride and her love
        G5            Bb(vi)  D5
Seeking guidance from above

SOLO with D5 improvisation

VERSE:
D5                       F              C
Amber waves of grain bow in the prairie wind
    Am7                           D5
I'm hearin' Willie singing on the radio again
D5                       F            C
That song from 911 keeps ringin in my head
     Am7                       D5
I'll always remember somethin' Chris Rock said

D5                         C
Don't send more candles no matter what you do
     Am                             D5
Then Willie stopped singin' and the prairie wind blew
D5                           C
The grain kept rollin on for miles and miles
Am                            D5
Fields of fuel rollin' on for miles

CHORUS:
C(v) D(vii)      Bb    C(v)   D(vii)
Tick tock    the clock on the wall
   F    C             D5
No wonder we're losin time
C(v) D(vii)   Bb     C(v)    D(vii)
Torn torn the fallen soldier fell 
    F                 C
The old church on the hill 
      G5                    Bb(vi)  D5
still standin' when so many fell

SOLO with D5 improvisation

VERSE:
D5                        F                     C
Back when I was young the birds blocked out the sun
Am7                        D5
Before the great migration stopped
D5                      F               C
We only shot a few they last the winter through
Am7                                     D5
Mother cooked them good and served them up
D5                       C
Somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair
   Am               D5
Behind a big wooden desk
D5                         C
The caribou he killed mean nothing to him
   Am                               D5
He took his money just like all the rest

CHORUS:
C(v) D(vii)   Bb    C(v)   D(vii)
Tick tock the clock on the wall
   F            C     D5
No wonder we're losin' time
C(v) D(vii)  Bb       C(v)    D(vii)
Ring ring    ring the wedding bells
    F               C
The bride takes the ring 
        G5           Bb(vi)  D5
And the happy people sing
