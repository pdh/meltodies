Here is some Bob Marley song. We have to fill this Bob_Marley directory.

There are only three chord in this song,but the most
important is to have a really cool right-hand rythm.
A pretty good exercise for playing reggae !

So, the general pattern of the song goes like this ...

       Bm               Em               Bm               F#m
