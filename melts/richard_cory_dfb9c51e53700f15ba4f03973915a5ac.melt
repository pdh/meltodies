Intro A7

Am                                  G
They say that Richard Cory owns one half of this whole town
     Am                       E7
With political connections to spread his wealth around
D5 
Born into society a banker's only child
       Am   G       C               E7
He had everything a man could want; power, grace and style


C                    Am
But I -- work in his factory
      D5
And i curse the life I'm living,

And I curse my poverty
                            C                      Am
And i wish that I could be, oh I wish that I could be
     D5                D7                Am
Oh I wish that i could be   -    Richard Cory

     Am                             G
The papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes
         Am                        E7
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show
         D5
And the rumours of his parties and the orgies on his yacht
        Am     G       C          E7
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got


C                    Am
But I -- work in his factory
      D5
And I curse the life I'm living,

And I curse my poverty
                            C                      Am
And i wish that I could be, oh I wish that I could be
     D5                D7                Am
Oh I wish that i could be   -    Richard Cory

    Am                          G
He freely gave to charities, he had the common touch
               Am                                  E7
And they were grateful for his patronage, and they thanked him very much
      D5 
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read
Am      G         C                         Am
Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head


C                    Am
But I -- work in his factory
      D5
And i curse the life I'm living,

And I curse my poverty
                            C                      Am
And i wish that I could be, oh I wish that I could be
     D5                E7                Am
Oh I wish that i could be   -    Richard Cory
