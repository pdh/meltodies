I play a lot in open D, so when I decided to learn this song, I figured out how to play
in that tuning. So, this is what I came up with. The top three strings are played open
all chords, and make this great drone effect that really captures the tone of this song. 
could also be played in open E - I think that would be the same key that Neil Young
it in.
If you have any questions email me (demarreg@csp.edu).

Open D: D-A-F#-D-A-D

Here's the chords:

Dm - 0-0-11-0-0-0--|
C - 10-10-10-0-0-0-|
Bb - 8-8-8-0-0-0---|
F - 3-3-3-0-0-0----|

Dm                           C - Bb
There's colors on the street
Dm                  C - Bb
Red, white and blue
Dm                          C - Bb
People shufflin' their feet
Dm                            C - Bb
People sleepin' in their shoes
Dm                                  C     Bb
But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
Dm                                     C          Bb
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
Dm                           C     Bb
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
Dm                         C     Bb
So I try to forget it, any way I can.

F        C                       Bb - Bb - Dm
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
F        C                       Bb - Bb - Dm
Keep on rockin' in the free world
F        C                       Bb - Bb - Dm
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
F        C                       Bb - Bb - Dm
Keep on rockin' in the free world.


(The same pattern goes for the rest of the song)

I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away,
and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life,
and what she's done to it
There's one more kid
that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love,
never get to be cool.

Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world.

We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler,
Machine gun hand
We got department stores
and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes
for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people,
says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn,
got roads to drive.

Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world.
