A                                 A7
A past that's sprinkled with the blues 
         D
a few old dreams that I can't use
A                 F7                           B7
who'll buy my mem'ries, of things that used to be
E7                     A              A7
There were the smiles, before the tears
                    D
and with the smiles some better years
A                  E7                          A
who'll buy my mem'ries of things, that used to be
A            D
When I remember how things were
       A
my memories all lead to her
         D
I'd like to start my life a new
A                        E7
but memories just make me blue
           A                   A7
A cottage small just built for two
      D
a garden wall with violets blue
A                 E7                          A
who'll buy my mem'ries of things that used to be
A             D
When I remember how things were
     A
my memories all lead to her
     D
I'd like to start my life a new
A                        E7
but memories just make me blue
           A                   A7
A cottage small just built for two
      D
a garden wall with violets blue
A                 E7                          A
who'll buy my mem'ries of things that used to be 
D                    A                  E7                         A
Who'll buy my mem'ries of things that used to be
