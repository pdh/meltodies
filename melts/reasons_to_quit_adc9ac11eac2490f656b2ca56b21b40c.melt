A                   D                                  A
Reasons to quit the smoke and booze don't do me like before 
        F#m                                             B              E 
And I'm hardly ever sober and my old friends don't come around much anymore  
A                   D                            A 
Reasons to quit the low is always lower than the high 
        A               E                               A 
And the reasons to quit donâ€™t outnumber all the reasons why 
           D                                 A 
So we keep smokin and we keep drinkin, havin fun and never thinkin'  
E                                 A 
Laughin' at the price tags the we pay 
            D                                  A  
And we keep roarin down the fast lane like two young men feelin no pain 
        A                               E           A 
And the reasons for quittin' are gettin bigger each day
A                D                                A
Reasons to quit, I cant afford the habit all the time 
               F#m                            B                E 
And I need be sober, I need to write some new songs that will rhyme 
A                 D                                       A
Reasons to quit, have no no rhyme or reason when your high 
         A               E                              A    
And the reasons to quit don't outnumber all the reasons why
           D                                 A 
So we keep smokin and we keep drinkin, havin fun and never thinkin'  
E                                 A 
Laughin' at the price tags the we pay 
            D                                  A  
And we keep roarin down the fast lane like two young men feelin no pain 
        A                               E           A 
And the reasons for quittin' are gettin bigger each day
        A                               E           A 
And the reasons for quittin' are gettin bigger each day
