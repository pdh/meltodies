Red Bandana
By Merle Haggard

Capo 1

        D                            G   
We left home when we was barely past eleventeen 
     D                                      A 
Been back and fourth and all around through hell and rain
     D                                           G
I've loved you half of your life and I’ll keep on lovin’ you
    D                  A                D 
But I can't change and live the way you want me to


We spend a lot of time out on the highway
Comin’ from some town we played along the way ss
After 30 years of knowing me the way you do ||
You know I can’t change and live the way you want me to-i

Chorus: But babe,
     A                            D 
That red bandana tied around your auburn hair 
    A                                    D
You look like you ought to be somebody's wife somewhere
          D                                           G
You ain't never going to be no Bobby McGee but you’re tryin’ to 
    D                  A                D
But I can't change and live the way you want me to 


Every time you leave the stage I know you've had your fill 
And I wonder why you grew up and why I never will 
Hey, I'm 41 today still going on 22
But I can't change and live the way you want me to 

Chorus 

I can't change and live the way you want me to
