G                   D7      G
I've been trying so hard to forget you
                  D7           G
But this chore of forgetting I find
       C                        G
Has me burning both ends of the candle
    D7                     G
And fighting a battle with time

                      D7          G
What I'd give just to sleep for a moment
                       D7        G
But it's a luxury that I can't afford
      C                      G
For I know that I just dream about you
       D7                       G
And my tears start falling once more

   C                            G
So I'm burning both ends of the candle
  D7                                  G
I just hope that it lasts through the night
    C                         G
For each moment the candle is burning
       D7                   G
Brings closer the ending of life

Repeat #3
