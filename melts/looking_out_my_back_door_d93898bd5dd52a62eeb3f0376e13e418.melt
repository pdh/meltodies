C                         Am
Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy !

Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch.

Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singing,

F         C         G           C
doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.




C                              Am
There's a giant doing cartwheels, a statue wearin' high heels,

F               C             G
look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn.

C                  Am
A dinosaur Victrola, listening to Buck Owens

F         C         G            C
doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.




G                          F            C
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band,

                    Am          G
won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon ?

C                     Am
Wond'rous apparition, provided by magician,

F        C           G           C
doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.

Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows,

doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.
