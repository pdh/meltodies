Sing A Traveling song

[C]Hey little girl with [Am]tears in your eyes
[F]Don't waste your time now [C]askin' me why
I don't know I know I'll [Am]just be [D7]movin' [G7]along

[C]You say that home is where [Am]my love is at
[F]I say that home is where [C]I hang my hat
The time has come to [G7]sing a travelin' [C]song

[C]You want a house and a [Am]lot of close friends
[F]I love the feel of my [C]back to the wind
The two won't match you know the [Am]cage the [D7]wild would be [G7]wrong

[C]You think that love is friends a [Am]child and a home
[F]You can't buy love on a [C]twenty year loan
The time has come to [G7)sing a travelin' [C]song

[C] Someday where we sat in your [Am]ol' porch swing
[F]A tamer man may [C]offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and [Am]neighbors a [D7]child and a [G7]home

[C]Don't waste your tears on love that [Am]never could be
[F]What's right for others just [C]ain't right for me
The time has come to [G7]sing a travelin' song[C]
