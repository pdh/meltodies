     / Am                    /                     / C                     / Am   / /
An / old cowboy went / riding out one / dark and windy / day, / /
       / Am               /                    / C                   / Am    / /
Up - / on a ridge he / rested as he / went along his / way,  / /
          / Am             /                       / F                        / Am
When / all at once a / mighty herd of / red-eyed cows he / saw,
Am                       / F                 / /        / F               / Am     / / /
Plowin' through the / ragged sky, / / and  / up a cloudy / draw,  / / /

        / Am                        /                    / C                             / Am    / /
Their / brands were still on / fire and their / hooves were made of / steel, / /
        / Am                           /                       / C                           / Am  / /
Their / horns were black and / shiny and their / hot breath he could / feel, / /
   / Am                   /                               / F                              / Am
A / bolt of fear went / through him as they / thundered through the / sky,
          / Am                 / F                  / /           /                               /  Am / /
For he / saw the riders / coming hard, / / and he / heard their mournful / cry.  / /

Chorus:

               / C   / /                 / Am  / /
Yippe-ai - / oh, / / yippee-a i- / ay,  / / (Coyote Yip)

   / /
Their / faces gaunt, their / eyes were blurred, their / shirts all soaked with / sweat, / /
        / Am             /                             / C                            / Am  / /
He's / ridin' hard to / catch that herd but / he ain't caught them / yet, / /
                     / Am                 /                   / F                    / Am
Cause they've / got to ride for - / ever on that / range up in the / sky,
     / Am                 / F    / /             / F                         / Am  / / / /
All / horses snortin' / fire, / / as they / ride on, hear them / cry. / / / /

As the / riders loped on / by him, he / heard one call his / name, / / / /
         / Am                     /                         / C               / Am
If you / want to save your / soul from hell, a / ridin' on our / range,
        / Am                          /                      / F                     /
Then / cowboy change your / ways today or / with us you will / ride,
Am                       / F                / /      / F                            / Am     / /
