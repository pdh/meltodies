Written by Jagger/Richards


[VERSE 1]
C         G                C             F  C
Why do my thoughts loom so large on me?
     G       G7       C         F
They seem to stay for day after day.
    G         G7          C           F
And won't disappear, I've tried every way.

[CHORUS 1]
    C   G      Am
But she smiled sweetly,
F   Em     Dm
She smiled sweetly,
F   G      C
She smiled sweetly,
G           C          F  C     
And says don't worry, 
G        C   F  C  G
Oh no no no

[VERSE 2]
C              G         C              F  C
Where does she hide it inside of her?
     G         G7         C     F
That keeps her peace most every day.
    G          G7       C              F
And won't disappear, my hair's turning gray.

[CHORUS 2]
    C   G      Am
But she smiled sweetly,
F   Em     Dm
She smiled sweetly,
F   G      C
She smiled sweetly,
G           C         F  C  G  
And says don't worry.

[BRIDGE]
C  F  C  G  C  C*

        G                 C      F  C
There's nothing in why or when.
        G  C   Dm             F
There's no use trying, you're here, 
      G                   G7
Begin again, and o'er again.

[VERSE 3]
C           G          C         F  C
That's what she said so softly
  G    G7        C          F
I understood for once in my life
    G       G7        C          F
And feeling good most all of the time

[CHORUS 3]
       C   G      Am
'Cause she smiled sweetly
F   Em     Dm
She smiled sweetly,
F   G      C
She smiled sweetly,
G        C             F  C  
And said don't worry,
G        C   F  C
Oh no no no, 
G        C   F  C
Oh no no no, 
G        C
Oh no no no
