{ci:Intro:}
[E]
#
[E]Feeling kind of boney
On the telephoney
Talking to Marconi
Eating Rice-A-Roni
[A]Nominated for Tony
For acting like a phoney
[E]Watching Twilight Zoney
On my forty-two inch Sony
Th[B7]is is just a long song
It ain't no poem
Le[E]ave the lights on till you baby gets home.

[E]It's like sitting in the kitchen
When the music's really bitchin'
Your nose it starts to itchin'
As you count your old age pension
D[A]id I forget to mention
The ride that I was hitchin'
To the al[E]uminum convention
I had such good intentions
Ke[B7]ep you cotton pickin' fingers off my song poem
And le[E]ave the lights on till you baby gets home.

Le[E]ave the lights on till you baby gets home.
Leave the lights on till you baby gets home.
Do[A]n't forget your toothbrush
Your hairbrush and your comb
L[E]eave the lights on till you baby gets home.
Got a b[B7]ig ol' dog
A chrome crowbar
I k[E]eep that mother humper in the back seat of my car
[E]      [A]       [E]        [B7]       [A]       [E]

[E]Me and Billy Shakespeare
Stepped out to get a root beer
We sat together so near
People thought we were queer
Pun[A]ctuated by the big scare
We joined the Air Force right there
To d[E]efend our country first class
Who couldn't give a rat's ass
Do[B7]n't you tell me that the White House is my home
Le[E]ave the lights on till you baby gets home.

Le[E]ave the lights on till you baby gets home.
Leave the lights on till you baby gets home.
Do[A]n't forget your toothbrush
Your hairbrush and your comb
Leave the lights on till you baby gets home.
Got a b[B7]ig ol' dog
A big iron bar
I k[E]eep that mother humper in the back seat of my car

[E]It's like kissing Greta Garbo
With a mouth full of marbles
  [A]
Like tr[E]ying to cash a paycheck
In the middle of a train wreck  [B7]
Le[E]ave the lights on
Leave the lights on

[E]Like trying to get aroundo
In a car made of bondo   [A]
Like sp[E]eaking German lingo
To a dog named Dingo[B7] - Plotz!!
[E]Leave the lights on
Leave the lights on

[E]Like a french-fried quesadilla
In a franchised pizzeria
 [A]
[E]Leave the lights on
Leave the lights on
[B7]
A big iron bar
I k[E]eep that mother humper in the back seat of my car
