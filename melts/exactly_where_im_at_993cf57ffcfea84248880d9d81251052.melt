G
Let's begin
          D
With the past in front
    Em
And all the things
     Bm                 C
You really don't care about now
          A
It'd be exactly where I'm at

G
And to think 
    D
You got a grip
Em
Look at yourself
      Bm                 C
Your lips are like two flaps of fat
         A  
They go front and back and flappity flap

G
I'm all staged
     D
It's all an act
    Em                    Bm                   C
I'm really scared that I may fall back on the abstract
          A
It'd be exactly where I'm at

    G
If you're to be
     D
The roaming eye
Em               Bm              C
Pry it open and let me tell you why it sees
     A
The harsh realities
