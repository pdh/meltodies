Intro: C  G  D  Em

Chorus:
                    C
Have you ever been lost?
                    G
Have you ever been found out?
                    D
Have you ever felt all alone
                  Em
at the end of the day?
                        C
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout gettin' down
                      G
Take it easy, there's no one around
                   D
Just a mirror and you and me
           Em
And the TV screen


I was walkin' down Main Street
Not the sidewalk, but Main Street
Dodgin' traffic with flyin' feet
That's how good I felt
Took a spin in the laundromat
Played a game in the music arcade
Kept winnin' while the band played
That's how good I felt

CHORUS

Have you ever been singled out
By a hungry man?
You're listenin' to the radio
He's washin' your window
When you look into those vacant eyes
How do you harmonize
With the things that you do

CHORUS

There's a comet in the sky tonight
Makes me feel like I'm alright
I've been movin' pretty fast
For my size
I really didn't mean to stay
As long as I have
So I'll be movin' on

end on: Em  Em7


There ya go: enjoy.
