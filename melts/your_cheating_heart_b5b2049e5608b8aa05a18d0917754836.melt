     YOUR CHEATING HEART WILL MAKE YOU WEEP
                    G              C
     YOU'LL CRY AND CRY AND TRY TO SLEEP
                                          F
     BUT SLEEP WON'T COME THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH

     WHEN TEARS COME DOWN LIKE FALLING RAIN
                 D7                 G   G7
     YOU'LL TOSS AROUND AND CALL MY NAME
                     C               F
     YOU'LL WALK THE FLOOR THE WAY I DO
                   G                  C
     YOUR CHEATING HEART WILL TELL ON YOU
