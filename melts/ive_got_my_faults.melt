************* I'VE GOT MY FAULTS ***************

written and performed by Waylon Jennings


Verse 1:
                    E
	I'm just a man

	No more or no less
         A
	Bad as the worst

	Good as the best
			      B
	If you like what you see

	It's a pretty good bet

	What you see

	Is just what you'll get


Chorus:
                           E
	And i've got my faults

	That i can't deny
            A
	Nobody knows that better than i do
                           B
	Some not so good traits

	From my wilder days
                                             E
	I've got my faults but i do have my ways


Bridge:
                      A
	I do have my ways
                                      E
	That show off the best side of me
                            A
	When you least expect it
                                     E
	You don't know how good i can be


Chorus.
