Title: My Back Pages
Artist: Bob Dylan
Album: Another Side of Bob Dylan




The chords vary from verse to verse and are never the same on the refrain
("Ah but I was so much older..."). If you are intent on learning the song
as it is on the album, the following notes might help:

Verse 1 is very different from the rest. You just gotta learn it.
Verses 2, 3, 4, and 6 are identical.
Verse 5 is similar to the other verses except the last part.
The refrains have different variations each time.

However, if youre not so picky about every detail, I recomend just learning
the chords to the last verse and refrain and using that pattern throughout.


Also, Dylan uses this little thing most of the G chords:


--3--3--3--

Capo 3

C

  C       Am         Em
Crimson flames tied through my ears
     F            G       C
Rollin' high and mighty traps
 C            Am       Em     C
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
  F         Em     G 
Using ideas as my maps
        F      Am       G         C
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I
 Am                   F      G
Proud 'neath heated brow.
     C                 Am     C
Ah, but I was so much older then,
     F        G        C 
I'm younger than that now.

G    G    G    G

  C            Am     Em
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
   F           G          C
"Rip down all hate," I screamed
 C        Am       Em
Lies that life is black and white
F                        G
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
   Am              Em
Romantic facts of musketeers
     F                  G
Foundationed deep, somehow.
        C      Am     Em      F
Ah, but I was so much older then,   
     G                C
I'm younger than that now.


    C         Am         Em
Girls' faces formed the forward path
       F    G     C
From phony jealousy
    C   Am     Em
To memorizing politics
   F             G
Of ancient history
    Am                 Em
Flung down by corpse evangelists
    F                      G
Unthought of, though, somehow.
      C               F       C
Ah, but I was so much older then,
     F        G        C
I'm younger than that now.


   C      Am        Em
A self-ordained professor's tongue
    F    G      C
Too serious to fool
  C      Am      Em
Spouted out that liberty
    F                  G
Is just equality in school
   Am           Em
"Equality," I spoke the word
   F             G
As if a wedding vow.
       C      Am
Ah, but I was so much older then,
 F           G         C
I'm younger than that now.


      C          Am        Em
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
        F       G         C
At the mongrel dogs who teach
 C                 Am         Em     
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
        F               G
In the instant that I preach
    Am                F        C
My existence led by confusion boats
 Am          Em       G
Mutiny from stern to bow.
        C      Am      F     C
Ah, but I was so much older then,
     G                 C
I'm younger than that now.

 
         C       Am            Em
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
     F     G     C
Too noble to neglect
    C        Am    Em
Deceived me into thinking
       F               G
I had something to protect
 Am                Em
Good and bad, I define these terms
 F                        G        
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
        C     Am       F      C
Ah, but I was so much older then,
      G                C
I'm younger than that now.
