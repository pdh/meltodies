 A             D
Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart,
  A                              E7
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you,
  A             A7           D  
I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part,
   A         E7            A
So, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart



A
Passed me by one sunny day,
D
Flashed those big brown eyes my way,
  A                         E7
I knew I wanted you for evermore,
A
I'm not one that gets around,
D
Swear my feet stuck to the ground,
    A           E7            A
Though I never did meet you before,

 A             D
Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart,
  A                              E7
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you,
  A             A7           D  
I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part,
   A         E7            A
So, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart


A
I saw your lips, I heard your voice,
D
Believe me, I just had no choice,
A                                 E7
Wild horses couldnâ€™t make me stay away,
A
I thought about a moonlit night,
D
My arms around you good and tight,
    A            E7             A       
That's all I had to see for me to say,

 A             D
Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart,
  A                              E7
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you,
  A             A7           D  
I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part,
    A         E7            A
So, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
    A         E7            A
So, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
    A         E7            A
So, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
