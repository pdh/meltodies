DIGNITY- Bob Dylan

TUNING: D A D F# A D
 
D                                   G D                                  D7
Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel,    thin man lookin' at his last meal
G			        D                     G  D
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield for dignity

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass, young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass for dignity

CHORUS #1:
A
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
G                             D
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
G                     F#m
I went into the city, went into the town
Em					   A    A
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low, searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go, "Have you seen Dignity?"

Blind man breakin' out of a trance, puts both his hands in the pocket of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-lou, she said I don't want nobody see me talkin to you
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity

CHORUS #2:
I went down where the vultures feed
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men, wasn't any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade, house on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years for dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity

CHORUS #3:
Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand, steps goin' down into tatoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light, in the bordertowns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat, I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote about dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure, lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin his hair back his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity

CHORUS #4:
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed, dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black, into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake, so many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity
