        A                    D
Another saturday night and I ain't got nobody
A                            E
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
    A                D
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
A         E     A
I'm in an awful way.

A               E
I got in town a month ago
A                              D
I've seen a lot of girls since then,
           A                D
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em
       A             D
But as yet I haven't met 'em
       A              E         A
That's how I'm in the state I'm in.

CHORUS
A             E
Another fella told me
         A                      D
He had a sister who looked just fine
           A          D
Instead of bein' my deliverance
    A               D
She had a strange resemblance
     A         E      A
To a cat named Frankenstein.


CHORUS

Its hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey
To help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town.

CHORUS

Another saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful, ooh, I'm in an awful way,
He's in an awful way, I'm in an awful ooh,
I'm in an awful way, He's in 
an awful way.
