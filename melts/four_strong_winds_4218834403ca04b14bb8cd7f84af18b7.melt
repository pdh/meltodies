                   Four Strong Winds
                   =================


      G           G               Am
      Four strong winds that blow lonely
            D             G
      Seven seas that run high
                G                 Am               D         D
      All those things that don't chnage come what may
              G                  Am
      For the good times are all gone
              D                G
      And I'm bound for moving on
                C              Am             D          D
      I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way


                G           Am
   I think I'll go out to Alberta
              D                 G
   Wheather's good there in the fall
                 G                  Am         D         D
   I've got some friends that I can go working for
           G                      Am
   Still I wish you'd change your mind
        D                G
   If I ask you one more time
             C                   Am              D        D
   But we've been through that a hundred times before


      G           G               Am
      Four strong winds that blow lonely
            D             G
      Seven seas that run high
                G                 Am               D         D
      All those things that don't chnage come what may
              G                  Am
      For the good times are all gone
              D                G
      And I'm bound for moving on
                C              Am             D          D
      I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way


            G                Am                 D                  G  
   If I get there before the snow flies, And if things are looking good
             G            Am                D         D
   You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
          G                Am
   But by then it would be winter
       D                   G
   Not too much for you to do
             C              Am                D         D
   And those winds sure can blow cold way out there      G           G               Am
      Four strong winds that blow lonely
            D             G
      Seven seas that run high
                G                 Am               D         D
      All those things that don't chnage come what may
              G                  Am
      For the good times are all gone
              D                G
      And I'm bound for moving on
                C              Am             D          D
      I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
