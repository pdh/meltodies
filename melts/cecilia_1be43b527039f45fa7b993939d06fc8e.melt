CHORUS:
 C                F         
Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
          C                  G
You're shaking my confidence daily
      F        C         
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
       F                        G
I'm begging you please to come home
         C
Come on home



CHORUS

 C                   F   
Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
          G
Up in my bedroom
      F              C
I got up to wash my face
                     C
When I come back to bed
           G         C
Someone's taken my place ...CHORUS
