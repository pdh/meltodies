B
Intro 
F#  
Too much of nothing
           E          B
Can make a man ill at ease
F#
One man's temper might rise
      E                          B
While another man's temper might freeze
       F#     G
In the day of confession
   G#            A
We cannot mock a soul
                A#          B
Oh when there's too much of nothing
C          C#
No one has control

CHORUS:
 E
Say hello to Valerie
 B
Say hello to Vivian
 E
Give her all my salary
       D      E   A    B
On the waters of oblivion
