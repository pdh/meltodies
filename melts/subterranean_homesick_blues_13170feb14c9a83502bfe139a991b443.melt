Capo @ 5th fret.

The chords given here are based on open positions with capo at
the 5th fret because that?s how Dylan plays it. I?m going to
call them Em, E, A7, and B because that is the positions you
are playing. (But for you music theorists, you and Dylan are
actually playing Am, A, D7, and E). Dig it?

Also, if you feel cheeky and want to use a harmonica, use a ?D?.

Em / E
Johnny?s in the basement mixing up the medicine,
I?m on the pavement thinking ?bout the government.
A man in a trench coat, bad job, laid off,
Says he?s got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off-

A7
Look out kid, it?s something you did,

Em / E
God knows when but you?re doing it again
Better duck down an alleyway,
Looking for a new friend.

B
A man in a coonskin-cap in a pig-pen

Em / E
Wants eleven dollar bills, and you only got ten.

[A7 w/ harmonica]

Em / E
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Face full of black soot
Talking that the Heat put
Plants in the bed, but
The phone?s tapped anyway.
Maggie says that many say
They must bus in early May,
Orders from the D.A.

A7
Look out kid, no matter what you did,

Em / E
Walk on your tip-toes,
Don?t tie no bows,
Better stay away from those
Who carry around a fire hose.

B
Keep a clean nose,
Wash your clean clothes,

Em / E
You don?t need a weatherman
To know which way the wind blows.

[A7 w/ harmonica]

Em / E
Get sick, get well,
Hang around an ink well,
Hang a bell, hard to tell
If anything?s gonna sell
Try hard, get barred,
Get back, ride the rails,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Join the army if you fail

A7
Look out kid, you?re gonna get hit

Em / E
By users, cheaters, six-time losers
Hanging around the theaters.

B
The girl by the whirlpool?s
Looking for a new fool,

Em / E
Don?t follow leaders
Watch the parking meters.

[A7 w/ harmonica]

Em / E
Get born, keep warm,
Short pants, Romance
Learn to dance, get dressed,
Get blessed, try to be a success.
Please her, please him,
Buy gifts, don?t steal, don?t lift,
Twenty years of schooling
And they put you on the day shift.

A7
Look out kid, they keep it all hid.

Em / E
Better jump down a man-hole,
Light yourself a candle.
Don?t wear sandals,
Try to avoid the scandals.

B
Don?t want to be a bum,
You better learn to chew gum

Em / E
The pump don?t work
?Cause the vandals took the handles!
