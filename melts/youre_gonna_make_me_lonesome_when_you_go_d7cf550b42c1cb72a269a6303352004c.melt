This is track five on "Blood on the Tracks", Bob Dylan's 1974 album.
It's also on Shawn Colvin's album "Cover Girl".
I play it in a much slower tempo than the Bob Dylan version, and slightly
slower than Shawn Colvin's, and I don't fingerpick.

Just strum the chords on an acoustic guitar to the rhythm of the song, 
it should work out. Then for the last line of each verse, 
the "chorus" of the song, there's a little fill:

   G           D
e|-3-----------2----|
B|-0---3----0--3----|
G|-0-----------2----|
D|-0-----------0----|
A|-2-----------x----|
E|-3-----------x----|
   ...when you go.

When he says "Honolulu", it sounds like "Honolula", so it rhymes with "Ashtabula."

D       xx0232  (or x00232 if you want)
F#m     244222
G       320003  (It's best to play this with the pinky on the high e string)

A couple of the phrases here are not known to all people, so:
Purple clover and Queen Anne's lace are plants common to the American northeast.
Verlaine and Rimbaud were French lovers in the 19th century. 
Verlaine shot Rimbaud (pronounced Rim-bo) in the left wrist.
Ashtabula is a port city in Ohio.

That's about it. Comments/questions/corrections to planetawesome@hotmail.com

Intro: D-F#m-G    D-G-D

D                 F#m              G
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before
D             F#m        G
Never been so easy or so slow
D                         F#m                 G
I've been shooting in the dark too long, when something isn't right it's wrong
D                    G                 D
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.

D                F#m         G
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
D                  F#m        G
It's always hit me right from below
D                         F#m           G
But this time around it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
D                    G                 D
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.

D              F#m                G
Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace, crimson hair across your face,
D                 F#m              G
You could make me cry if you don't know
D                         F#m              G
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of, you might be spoilin' me too much love,
D                    G                 D
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.

G                                 D
Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy
G                                  D
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme
E
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy
Asus4                          A
I could stay with you forever, and never realize the time.

D               F#m        G
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad
D                 F#m               G
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
D                  F#m           G
But there's no way I can compare all those scenes to this affair
D                    G                 D
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.

G                                    D
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doin'
G                          D
Stayin' far behind without you
E
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin'
Asus4                            A      
You're gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to.

D                        F#m       G
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, and Ashtabula
D                    F#m           G
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know.
D                       F#m               G
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, and in the ones I love,
D                    G                 D
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
D                       F#m                 G
But I'll see you in the stars above, in the tall grass, and in the ones I love,
D                    G                 D
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
D                    G                 D (let ring)
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
