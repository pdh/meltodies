Verse 1:
                 G                     C
	Why me Lord? What have i ever done?
                        G
	To deserve even one
                               D
	Of the pleasures i've known
                 G                 C
	Tell me Lord.What did i ever do
                            G
	That was worth loving you
                 D              G
	Or the kindness you've shown


Chorus:
 C                       G                   D                 G
Lord help me Jesus,i've wasted it so help me Jesus,i know what I am
C                      G                     D                      G
Now that i know,that i needed you so help me Jesus,my soul's in your hands


Verse 2:
                G                        C
	Try me Lord.If you think there's a way
                        G
	I can't try to repay
                            D
	All i've taken from you
                G                    C
	Maybe Lord.I can show someone else
                                 G
	What i've been through myself
               D           G
	On my way back to you


Repeat chorus twice

          D                      G
	Jesus,my soul's in your hands.
