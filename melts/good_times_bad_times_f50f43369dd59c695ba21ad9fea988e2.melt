Good times, Bad times - Led Zeppelin


E                                D                       E   D
In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
E                                      D                               
  E  D
Now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
E                           D                        E  D
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

A            F#  G        A              F# 
 G
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
B               A                E
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
B
Well, I still don't seem to care

F#                                      F#
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
Only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend

B           Esus4  E   B             Esus4  
 E
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
C#             B                 G*
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
C#
Well, I still don't seem to care

Solo &gt; E5, D5, A5 (8x)

A           Dsus4  D   A             Dsus4  D
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
B             Esus4   E          B
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
B
Well, I still don't seem to care

E                                    D                  E     D
I know what it means to be alone, I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say, I'm gonna love you each
And every day, you can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part



 G*
