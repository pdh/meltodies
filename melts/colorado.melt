Colorado  

A                            A7       D            A 
There's a place where mother nature's got it all together
    D          C#m     D   A            E 
She knows just when to let wild flowers bloom
    A                    A7       D                 A
Somehow she always seems to know exactly what she's doin'
        D        C#m    D       A     E
And the lord saw fit to furnish elbow room.

Chorus:
         A         A7           D            
Have you ever been down to Colorado
  E              E7               D 
I spend a lot of time there in my mind.
       A           A7          D            
And if God doesn't live in Colorado
     E                   E7                 D
I'll bet that's where he spends most of his time.

I'd love to be there watching early in the morning
The sun comes up and crowns the mountain king
If by chance you dare to be there high upon the mountain
I swear that you can hear the angels sing.

Chorus
