Verse-1
=======
G            C                 G
Used to play in a rock 'n roll band,
G              C
They broke up
G             C           G
We were young and we were wild
G          C
It tore us up
D                                   G       C-G-C-G
Now I aint' gonna say who was right or wrong


Verse-2
=======
Looking out on a big green lawn,
Girls and boys
Playing in the afternoon sun,
And life's a joy
I heard an old song playing on a radio


Chorus
======
D       Em          C12
Buffalo Springfield again


Play Solo
=========


Verse-3
=======
Like to see those guys again
Give it a shot
Maybe now we can show the world
What we got
But I'd just like to play for the fun we had

Solo:
