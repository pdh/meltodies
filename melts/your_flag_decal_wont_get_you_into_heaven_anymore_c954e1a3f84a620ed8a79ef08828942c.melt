        G                             C
While digesting Readers Digest in the back of a dirty book store
  D                                                 G
A plastic flag with gum on the back Fell out on the floor.
       G                                                       C
Well I picked it up and ran outside And slapped it on my windowshield.
       D                                                 G
And If I could see old Betsy Ross Id tell her how good I feel.



(Chorus)
          C                             G
But, your flag decal won’t get you into Heaven anymore.
          D                           G                      
They’re already overcrowded From your dirty little war
    C                                  G
Now Jesus don’t like Killin’ No matter what the reasons for.
         D                                       G     Bb  C  D                 
And your flag decal won’t get you into Heaven anymore.


       G                                     C
Well I went to the Bank this morning And the cashier said to me
D                                                                   G
If you join the Christmas Club We'll give you ten of them flags for free.
G                                                    C
I didn’t mess a round a bit I took him up on what he said
    D                                                           G
And stuck them stickers all over my car And one on my wifes forehead.



(Chorus)



       G                                                 C
Well I got my windshield so filled with flags I couldn’t see
     D                                         G
So I ran my car upside a curb and right into a tree
       G                                         C
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead,
         D
And I’ll never understand Why the man,
                             G
Standing in the Pearly Gates said…



(Chorus)
