Capo on the 5th fret

V1:
         G
I knew a girl who was almost a lady
          C                            G
She had a way with all the men in her life
       D
Every inch of her blossomed in beauty
        C                       G
She was born on the fourth of July

V2:
          G
Well, she lived in an aluminum house trailer
         C                     G
And she worked in a jukebox saloon
          D       
And she spent all the money that I give her
         C                      G
Just to see the ol' man in the moon

CHORUS:
           G
I used to sleep at the foot of Old Glory
       C                      G
And awake in the dawn's early light
         C                      G
But much to my surprise, when I opened my eyes
         D                        G    C   G  C  G
I was a victim of the great compromise

V3:
           G
Well, we'd go out on Saturday evenings
        C                      G
To the drive-in on Route Forty-One
            D    
And it was there that I first suspected
        C                        G
She was doing what she'd already done

V4:
          G
She said "Johnny, won't you get me some popcorn?"
        C                         G
And she knew I had to walk pretty far
       D        
And as soon as I passed through the moonlight
           C                     G
She hopped into a foreign sports car


REPEAT CHORUS

V5:
          G
Well, you know, I could have beat up the feller
           C                           G
But it was her who had hopped into his car
        D      
As many times as I'd fought to protect her
C                           G
This time she was goin' too far

V6:
        G
Now, some folks, they call me a coward
         C                             G
'Cause I left her at the drive-in that night
        D
But I'd rather have names thrown at me
        C                            G
Than to fight for a thing that ain't right


REPEAT CHORUS

V7:
         G
Now she writes all the fellers love letters
         C                              G
Saying "Greetings! Come and see me real soon!"
         D         
And they go and line up the barroom
              C                          G
To spend the night in that sick woman's room

V8:
     G
But sometimes, I get awful lonesome
      C                       G
And I wish she was my girl instead
        D
But she won't let me live with her
        C                   G
And she makes me live in my head


REPEAT CHORUS
