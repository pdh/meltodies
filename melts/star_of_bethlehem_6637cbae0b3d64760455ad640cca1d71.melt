STAR OF BETHLEHEM

D         G             A              D
Ain't it hard when you wake up in the morning

          G             A              D
and you find out those other days are gone?

 G               A           D
All you have is memories of happiness

E          A  G  F#m7
linger in' on.


All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you;
they're only passing through you in the end.
They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to,
and wait for you to come back again.

Yet still a light is shining
from that lamp on down the hall.
 Maybe the star of Bethlehem
wasn't a star at all.
