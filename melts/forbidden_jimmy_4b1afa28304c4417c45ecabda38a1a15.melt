Forbidden Jimmy by John Prine


 G
Forbidden Jimmy
                        D
Has got a mighty sore tooth
                      C
From biting too many dimes
D                G
In a telephone booth

G
He's got half of his boot lace
               D
Tied to the dial
                 C
Well thank you operator
D                      G
For getting Jimmy to smile

G
"Call out the coast guard"
                  D
Screamed the police
              C
Forbidden Jimmy
D                      G
He's got three water skis

G
He put two on his wavelength
                      D
And gave one to his girl
                      C
She's a mighty fine person
D                     G
It's a mighty fine world
  
                          C
I'm gonna make all your sorrows bright
                G
Set your soul free
                 C
I'll see you tomorrow night
                D
If I can still see

G
Ginger Caputo
              D
And Dorian Gray
                       C
Oughta stay out of pictures
D                      G
If they got nothin' to say

G
Stack 'em back on the rack Jack
                            D
Ya know, you're hurting my eye
              C
Forbidden Jimmy
D                       G
He's getting ready to fly

                        C
Gonna make all your sorrows bright
                G
Set your soul free
                 C
I'll see you tomorrow night
                D
If I can still see

G
I got caught cooking popcorn
                 D
And calling it hail
                      C
They wanna stick my head
D                G
Inside a water pail

G
Ya know, they're gonna be sorry
                          D
They're gonna pay for it too
            C
Forbidden jimmy
D                       G
He's coming straight at you
