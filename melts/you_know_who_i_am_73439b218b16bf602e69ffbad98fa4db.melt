YOU KNOW WHO I AM- Leonard Cohen

Am (riff 2x)
 Am              Bm
I cannot follow you my love
Am                Bm
You cannot follow me
D                      A
I am the distance you put between
              G    G/F#         E
All of the moments that we will be

CHORUS:
     D          A
You know who I am
          D           A
You've stared at the sun
     D         A
Well I am the one who loves
    G          G/#        E    Am (riff)
Changing from nothing to one

Sometimes I need you naked
Sometimes I need you wild
I need you to carry my children in
And I need you to kill a child ...CHORUS

If you should ever track me down
I will surrender there
And I will leave with you one broken man
Whom I will teach you to repair ...CHORUS

I cannot follow you, my love
You cannot follow me
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be ...CHORUS
