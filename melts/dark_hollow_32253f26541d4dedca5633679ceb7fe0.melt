THIS IS DARK HOLLOW BY THE GRATEFUL DEAD
(CHORDS ONLY)

VERSE 1:
E*  F#* G* A     E         A
I'D RATHER BE IN SOME DARK HOLLOW
          A         D    A
WHERE THE SUN DON'T EVER SHINE
        A           A7   D 
THEN TO BE AT HOME ALONE KNOWIN THAT YOUR GONE
      A           E       A
WOULD CAUSE ME TO LOSE MY MIND

CHORUS:
G* A         E       A
SO BLOW YOUR WHISTLE FREIGHT TRAIN
        A      D        A
TAKE ME FAR ON DOWN THE TRACK
    A       A7      D         D7
I'M GOING AWAY, I'M LEAVING TODAY
    A            E            A
I'M GOING, BUT I AIN'T COMIN' BACK

VERSE 2:
I'D RATHER BE IN SOME DARK HOLLOW
WHERE THE SUN DONT EVER SHINE
THEN TO BE IN SOME BIG CITY,
IN A SMALL ROOM, WITH YOU ON MY MIND

CHORUS

VERSE 3:
I'D RATHER BE IN SOME DARK HOLLOW
WHERE THE SUN DON'T EVER SHINE
THEN TO SEE YOU ANOTHER MANS DARLIN',
AND TO KNOW THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE MINE
