Dad's Gonna Kill Me 

B
Out in the desert there’s a soldier lying dead
Vultures pecking the eyes out of his head
Another day that could have been me there instead
Nobody loves me here, nobody loves me here
G           Bm       G           Bm
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me, Dad’s Gonna Kill Me

You hit the booby trap and you’re in pieces
With every bullet your risk increases
Old Ali Baba, he’s a different species
Nobody loves me here, nobody loves me here
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me, Dad’s Gonna Kill Me

D
I’m dead meat in my Humevee Frankenstein
I hit the road block, God knows I never hit the mine
                                      E
The dice rolled and I got lucky this time
G F#m       Bm       G F#m       Bm
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me, Dad’s Gonna Kill Me

I’ve got a wife, a kid, another on the way
I might get home if I can live through today
Before I came out here I never used to pray
Nobody loves me here, nobody loves me here
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me

Dad’s in a bad mood, Dad’s got the blues
It’s someone else’s mess that I didn’t choose
At least we’re winning on the Fox Evening News
Nobody loves me here
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me, Dad’s Gonna Kill Me 

Dawn Patrol went out and didn’t come back
Hug the wire and pray like I told you, Mac
Or they’ll be shovelling bits of you into a sack
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me.

And who’s that stranger walking in my dreams
And whose that stranger cast a shadow ‘cross my heart
And who’s that stranger, I dare speak his name
Must be old Death a-walking, must be old Death a-walking
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me

7 muzzle monkeys standing in a row
Standing waiting for The Sandbox to blow
Sitting targets in the wild west show
Nobody loves me here
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me

Another angel got his wings this week
Charbroiled with his own Willie Pete
Nobody’s dying if you speak double-speak
Dad’s Gonna Kill Me
