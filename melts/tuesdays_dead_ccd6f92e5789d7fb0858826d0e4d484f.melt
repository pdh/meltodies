D           A       D     G               A       D
If I make a mark in time, I can't say the mark is mine. 
                  A     G      A
I'm only the underline, of the Word. 
     D             A         D    G                A       D
Yes, I'm like him, just like you, I can't tell you what to do. 
                        A         D     G         A
Like everybody else I'm searching thru, what I've heard. 

D     G            D   G                   A         D
Whoa, where do you go? When you don't want no one to know? 
D    G      D       G         A  D
Who, told tomorrow, Tuesday's dead?

Oh preacher won't you paint my dream, won't you show me where you've been 
                       A        G       A
Show me what I haven't seen, to ease my mind. 
      D               A    D      G           A       D
Cause I will learn to understand, if I have a helping hand. 
                 A        D     G      A
I wouldn't make another demand, all my life. 

D     G            D   G                   A         D
Whoa, where do you go? When you don't want no one to know?

Who, told tomorrow, Tuesday's dead? 

D              A         D     G               A       D
What's my sex, what's my name, all in all it's all the same. 
                  A         D     G       A
Everybody plays a different game, that is all. 
     D             A       D    G                 A        D
Now, man may live, man may die, searching for the question why. 
                   A        D    G       A
But if he tries to rule the sky, he must fall. 

D     G            D   G                   A         D
Whoa, where do you go? When you don't want no one to know?

Who, told tomorrow, Tuesday's dead? 

    D            A      D         G              A    D
Now every second on the nose, the humdrum of the city grows. 
               A        D       G      A
reaching out beyond the throes, of our time. 
D              A        D     G              A         D
We must try to shake it down, do our best to break the ground. 
                A      D      G        A
Try to turn the world around, one more time. 

      D              A        D     G              A         D
Yeah, we must try to shake it down, do our best to break the ground. 
                A      D      G        A
Try to turn the world around, one more time.

D     G            D   G                   A         D
Whoa, where do you go? When you don't want no one to know? 
D    G      D       G         A  D
Who, told tomorrow, Tuesday's dead?
