G                                      C         G
I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
G                         A         D 
I'm gonna leave this town til you decide
G                                C             G
Which one you want the most them Opry stars or me
G                          D         G
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville Tennessee


G                            C            G
Milwaukee is where we were before we came here
G                               A      D
Working in a brewery making the finest beer
G                                     C                G
You came to me on a payday night said lets go to Tennessee
G                               D         G
So we drove to Nashville to the Grand Ole Opry



(Repeat Chorus)

G                          C                G
We were watching TV Ernest Tubb was singing loud
G                              A                  D
I said that's the man for me I love him theres no doubt
G                                C                  G
I'm leaving you and going now to find out where hes at
G                                       D                G
If I can't get him I'll settle for that bluegrass Lester Flatt.


G                                      C         G
I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
G                         A         D
I'm gonna leave this town til you decide
G                           C           G
Which one you want the most me or Jerry Lee
G                          D         G
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville Tennessee
G                          D         G
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville Tennessee
