THANKSGIVING PRAYER 
by Johnny Cash &amp; Josef Anderson

CAPO ON 2nd fret - The song is in A, but played in G on capoed guitar
A country waltz in 3. 
A quarter note is about 134 BPM 
The lower case letter next to the chord is the bass note played  
in the basic 3-beat strumming pattern of: bass note, chord, chord

As of September 2013 this song has not been officially released.
As incredible as it may seem, this is only available on the 3rd season, 9th 
episode of the TV show Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. 
The episode is titled Thanksgiving.
Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash were guest stars on that episode. 
You can find the clip if you search YouTube.
