    Well I won't back down, no I won't back down
             D     E          D

    Hey, I will stand my ground and I won't back down


    Well I know what's right I got just one life
    In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
    But I'll stand my ground and I won't back down

    Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
    Hey, I will stand my ground and I won't back down
    And I won't back down
    No I won't back down
