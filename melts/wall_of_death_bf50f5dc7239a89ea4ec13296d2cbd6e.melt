THE WALL OF DEATH
Richard Thompson

(12 string is played capoed 2nd fret,
chords are written here at concert pitch.
Play rhythm part with lots of suspensions
and D scale runs, especially on the A and D chords)

Intro A D A D A D A D

       A                   D              A   Asus4 A
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
A A/G# F#m                 D              E
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
        D
You can waste your time on the other rides
    E
but this is the nearest to being alive
A              D              E       A   Asus4 A
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

You can go with the crazy people in the crooked house
You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse
The tunnel of love might amuse you
And Noah's Ark might confuse you but
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

       Bm      F#m
On the Wall of Death
        Bm       F#m      E
All the World is far from me
       Bm      F#m
On the Wall of Death
         Bm         F#m   D     E
It's the nearest to being free

Well you're going nowhere when you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong, but what's the good of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy
Beware of the bearded lady
Oh let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

(guitar solo over bridge chords)

Repeat first verse
