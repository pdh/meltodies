D                                                   G
Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
        A                                       D
They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold
                                                            G
Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levi's and each night begins a new day
             A
If you don't understand him and he don't die young
                         D
He'll probably just ride away

D                                         G
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
      A
Don't let them pick guitars and drive them old trucks
                                     D
Make them be doctors and lawyers and such
                                          G
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
              A
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
                       D
Even with someone they love

E                                                        A
Cowboys like smokey ol' pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
B                                                 E
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night

Them that don't know him won't like him
                  A
And them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
    B
He ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him
                                        E
Do the things that make you think he's right

E                                         A
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
        B
Don't let them pick guitars and drive them old trucks
                                     E
Make them be doctors and lawyers and such
                                          A
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
              B
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
                       E
Even with someone they love
