Bm               Am7
 Our conversation  was short and sweet
Bm                 Am7
 It nearly swept me  off-a my feet.
        G                   C
And I'm back in the rain, oh
                   G        C
And you are on dry land,
                      Am7
You made it there somehow
Bm7         Am7      D7/F# G       D/F#
  You're a big girl now.

Bm                    Am7
 Bird on the horizon, sittin' on fence
Bm                           Am7
 He's singin' his song for me at his own expense
        G                   C
And I'm just like that bird, oh,
                 G        C
Singin' just for you
                      Am7
I hope that you can hear,
Bm7         Am7      D7/F# G              D/F#
  Hear me singin' through these tears.

Bm                   Am7
  Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Bm                             Am7
  You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days .
                 G                C
Oh, I know where I can find You, oh,
              G       C
In somebody's room.
                      Am7
It's a price I have to pay
Bm7         Am7      D7/F# G          D/F#
  You're a big girl all the way.

Bm                     Am7
  Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Bm                      Am7
  Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last.
      G                C
I can change, I swear, oh
            G         C
See what you can do,
              Am7
I can make it through,
Bm7         Am7      D7/F# G       D/F#
  You can make it too.

Bm                        Am7
  A change in the weather can be extreme
Bm                          Am7
  But it ain't like changing horses in midstream
          G               C
I'm going out of my mind, oh
                 G                 C
With a pain that stops and starts,
                       Am7
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Bm7         Am7      D7/F# G       D/F#
Ever since we've been apart.
