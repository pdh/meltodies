                 C
Have mercy on me baby

I'm down upon my knees
                 F
Have mercy on me baby
                    C
I'll do just as you please
                     G
Well you know that I love you
                      F
I'll put no one else above you
                 C               G
Have mercy on me baby, have mercy

                 C
Have mercy on me baby

Please have a little heart
                 F
Have mercy on me baby
                   C
You're tearing me apart
                 G
The way that you do me
                      F
You know you done got to me
                 C               G
Have mercy on me baby, have mercy

F
She's got you hypnotized
         C
And your brain is paralyzed
    F                            C
You know she's only playing with you
       F
Like a puppet on a string
  C
Remember just one thing
G
She can't love you like I do, no


                 C
Have mercy on me baby
                       
Please give this heart a break
                 F
Have mercy on me baby
                     C
I'll do just what it takes
                     G
You know you won't regret it
                   F
So hey there now I said it
                 C               G
Have mercy on me baby, have mercy


C
