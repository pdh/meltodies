D
I was ridin' Number Nine,
        G                  D
Headin' south from Caroline.
                 A7               D
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

Got in trouble, had to roam,
        G                 D
Left my gal an' left my home.
                 A7              D
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

G
Just a kid, actin' smart,
            D
I went and broke my darling's heart,
A7
I guess I was too young to know.
D
They took me off the Georgia Main,
          G                 D
Locked me to a ball and chain.
                 A7               D
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

D
All alone I bear the shame,
       G                D
I'm a number, not a name.
                A7               D
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

All I do is set [sic] an' cry
           G                  D
When the evenin' train goes by.
                 A7               D
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

G
I'll be locked here in this cell
        D
Till my body's just a shell
       A7
An' my hair turns whiter than snow.
D
I'll never see that gal of mine.
             G                 D
Lord, I'm in Georgia doin' time.
                 A7
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
