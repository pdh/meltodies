I think it sounds better if you play it with your fingers and not with a
pic. So just strumm the low string with your thumb with a down-stroke and
the high string with your index finger with an up-stroke.



G        Gmaj7		   G6           G
Spent my days with a woman unkind
G         Gmaj7     G6       G          D
smoked my stuff and drank               all my wine

Made up my mind make a new start
goin' California with an achin in my heart

someone told me there's a girl out there,
with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

took my chances on a big jet plane,
never let them you that they're all the same

oh, sea was red ant the sky was grey,
wondered howw tomorroew could ever follow today

mountains and the cayons start to tremble and shake,
chilrden of the sun begin to awake


Dm									
seems that the wrath of the gods got a punch on the nose, ant it started to 
                        A7
flow i think i might be sinkin'


Dm								    	   
Throw me a line if i reach you in time, meet me up there where the path runs
             A7 
srtaight and high.


G        Gmaj7            G6     G
To find a queen without a king, 
G                  Gmaj7        G6   G              D  
they say she plays guitar and cries                and sings             lalalala

ride a white a mare in the footsteps of dawn,
tryin' to find a woman who's never nerver been born

standin on a hill in the mountains of dreams,
tellin myself it's not as hard, hard as it seems        mhh
