C
Six foot six stood on the ground, weighted 235 pounds
               DM                     G                     C 
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love

C
He was the kind of a man who would gamble on love
Look you in the eye and never back up
              Dm                           G               C   
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love

C                                                F
Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
         EM                    AM
Like the rules that govern our land

                 F                          Dm                  G
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love

C                                  F
It can lift you up, it can put you down

EM                              AM
Take your world and turn it all around

           C                         G                         C
Ever since time nothing's ever been found thatâ€™s stronger than love

Men like me they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about a little word like love

But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the worlds
