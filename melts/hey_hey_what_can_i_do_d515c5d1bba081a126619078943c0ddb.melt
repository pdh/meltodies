VERSE 1
A                        G
Wanna tell you about the girl I love
D
My she looks so fine
A                       G
She's the only one that I been dreamin' of
D
Maybe someday she will be all mine
A                     G
I wanna tell her that I love her so
D
I thrill with her every touch
A                            G                    (pause)
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

CHORUS
A              G              D(same for each line in chorus)
I got a woman, wanna ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true

VERSE 2
A                      G
Sunday morning when we go down to church
D
See the menfolk standin' in line
A                    G
I said they come to pray to the Lord
D
With my little girl, looks so fine
A                        G
In the evening when the sun is sinkin' low
D
Everybody's with the one they love
A                        G
I walk the town, Keep a-searchin' all around
D
Lookin' for my street corner girl

CHORUS (same chords as chorus above)
I got a woman, wanna ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true

VERSE 3(same chords as verse above)
In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times

My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all the time

I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Gonna pack my bags and move on my way

Cause I got a worried mind, Sharin' what I thought was mine
Gonna leave her where the guitars play

CHORUS
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, wanna ball all day
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman and she won't be true

(Hey hey what can I do)

I said she won't be true

(Hey Hey, What can I say?)

Hey hey, what can I do
I got a woman, she won't be true
Lord, hear what I say
I got a woman, wanna ball all day
