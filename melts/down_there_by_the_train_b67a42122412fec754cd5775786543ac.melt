(slow strumming)

          D       D7             G          D
There's a place I know where the train goes slow
                        D7            G            A
Where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb
          D            D7           G           D
There's a river by the trestle down by sinner's grove
               D7             A7    G    D
Down where the willow and the dog - wood grow

        G        D                G        D
You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell
                  D7            G        A7
From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell
            G            D                  A7       D
And there's room for the forsaken if you're there on time
                             D7       G
You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes ...if you're...

(start alternating bass/thumbpicking)

Chorus:

D
Down there by the train
A7
Down there by the train
D
Down there by the train
G
Down there by the train
D                          A7   D
Down there where the train goes slow

          D      D7        G                     D
There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist
      D              D7       G          A7
And I know that your name can be on that list
           D          D7              G           D
There's no eye for an eye, there's no tooth for a tooth
      D       D7              A7          G
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth... he was...


chorus

          D             D7              G             D
If you've lost all your hope, if you've lost all your faith
  D               D7              G               A7
I know you can be cared for and I know you can be safe
    D       D7            G          D
And all the shamefuls and all of the whores
             D7                      A7          G
And even the soldier who pierced the side of the Lord 


chorus

      D                   D7                G            D
Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer
                 D7    G           A7
Never given of myself, never truly cared
     D                 D7               G             D
I've left the ones who loved me and I'm still raising Cain
               D7              A7              G
I've taken the low road and if you've done the same... meet me...
