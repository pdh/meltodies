G                   C                               G
Reasons to quit the smoke and beer don't do me like before
            Em
And I'm hardly ever sober and my old friends
           A7         D7
Don't come round much anymore 
G                    C                            G
Reasons to quit the  low is always lower than the high
                              D7                              G
And the reasons for quitting  don't outnumber all the reasons why
 
           C
So we keep smoking and we keep drinking
       G
Having fun and never thinking
D7                                    G
Laughing at the price tags that the we pay
            C
And we keep roaring down the fast lane
         G
Like two young men feeling no pain
                                 D7                  G
And the reasons for quitting are getting bigger each day
 
                  C                              G
Reasons to quit I can't afford the habit all the time
              Em                           A7              D7
And I need be sober I gotta write some new songs that will rhyme
G                     C                                  G
Reasons to quit there ain't no rhyme or reason when your high
                             D7                              G
And the reasons for quitting don't outnumber all the reasons why
 
Repeat #2
