D              Dmaj7              G     Gmaj7
 Mama's waiting at the top of the hill,
A                    A                       G
 They'll be laughing, oh the stories they'll tell...

 When he holds her in his arms again,
A                      A                   G  A
 They'll be sweethearts with time on their hands
