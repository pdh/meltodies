			   Chimes of Freedom
			      (Bob Dylan)

Lyrics are from Dylan's "Another Side of Bob Dylan."  This version is
from Roger McGuinn's latest (5/23/95) live shows, per my recollection.
The 12-string guitar is tuned down 1/2 step.  The variations between
Dylan and The Byrds are shown in brackets -- square for Dylan's lyrics
that The Byrds/McGuinn left out and pointy for those they added.

G                         C9
Far between the sundown's finish
    G                C9
and midnights broken toll
   G      
we ducked inside 
    C9           D              G        (notes: B C D G...)
the doorway [as] thunder [went] crashing


   G                 C9
As majestic bells of bolts
       G              C9
struck shadows in the sounds
G                 C9        D       G
seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing

(notes on low E string and open D: G F# E D...)


D
Flashing for the warriors 
      G           C9     G
whose strength is not to fight
C9               C9/B
flashing for the refugees
       Am              D
of the unarmed road of flight
        G              C9
and for each and every underdog
G              C9
soldier in the night
       G              C9        D       G       (notes: B C D G...)
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[The Byrds skipped the next few verses]

There are cities melted furnace
unexpectedly we watched
with faces hidden as the walls were tightening

As the echo of the wedding bells
before the blowing rain
dissolved into the bells of the lightning

Tolling for the rebel
tolling for the rake
tolling for the luckless
they are bound and damned forsaked
tolling for the outcasts 
burning constantly at stake
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the mad mystic hammering
and the wild ripping hail
the sky cracked its farms in naked wonder

As the clanging of the church bells
blew far into the breeze
leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder

Striking for the gentle
striking for the kind
striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
and the poet and painter 
far behind his rightful time
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

In the wild cathedral evening
the rain unravelled tales
for a disrobed faceless farms of no position

Tolling for the tongues
with no place to bring their thoughts
all down and taken for granted situations

Tolling for the deaf and blind
tolling for the mute
for a mistreated maidless mother, a mistitled prostitute
for the misdemeanor outlaw
chained and cheated by pursuit
and we gaze upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[The Byrds pick it up here]

Even though the cloud's white curtain
in a far off corner [flowered] &lt;flashed&gt;
and the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting

Electric light&lt;s&gt; still struck like arrows
fired but [further ones] &lt;for the ones&gt;
condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting

Tolling for the searching ones
on their speechless seeking trail
for the lonesome hearted lovers with too personal a tale
and for each unharmful gentle soul
misplaced inside a jail
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Byrds/McGuinn:
        C               C9/B            D
	dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
        C               C9/B        D       G
	dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee-duh]

Starry eyes and laughing
as I recall when we were caught
[trapped] &lt;can't find&gt; no track [for] &lt;of&gt; ours for they hang suspended

As we listened one last time
and we watched with one last look
spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended

Tolling for the aching &lt;ones&gt;
whose wounds cannot be nursed
or the countless confused accused misused
strung out ones and worse
and for every hung up person
in the whole wide universe
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Byrds: dee dee...]
