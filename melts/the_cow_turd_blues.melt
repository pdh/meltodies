E                                             A
There's some things in this country you don't mess with
    E                          B7
And I am blessed to be on that short list
               E
We're out here in the real world
         A
Not that feel good media swirl
    E               B7                 E
And we've something for you â€“ read our lips

E
They made a huge miscalculation
          A
About the mood of this nation
             E                              B7
Good workin' people done got tired of bein' wronged
          E
Then they saw one of their own
       D                  A   G
Get mistreated and dumped on
          E               B7            E
They were standin' behind him, he's not alone

G D A 

[Spoken:] 
G                                           D 
I wanna dedicate this song to Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood,
        A
and the first man that said this - President Harry Truman

A                     G    D
Never kick a cow turd on a hot day
   E                              A
Or you might get some poo on your pants legs
Thought they were gonna have some fun
         D
Kickin' around old Hank's son
    E                           A
But America had my back all the way

A                              G    D
Remember never kick a cow turd on a hot day
E                                A
Never pick up a rattle snake the wrong way
                                    D
Never ever kick, would've been much smarter just let it slip
E
Never kick a cow turd, should've let the man just be heard
                           A
Never kick a cow turd on a hot day

Yee-haw! Sooey!
