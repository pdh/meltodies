D                                        D7          G
A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way
    A7                                              D
The good life he promised ain't what she's living today
D                                           D7              G
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
         A7                                                               D
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to
come

CHORUS:
D                                         D7          G
She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
    A7                                                 D
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
D                                                         D7            G
Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand-in-hand,
  A7                                        D
A good-hearted woman loving her good timing man

He like the night life, the bright lights and good-timin' friends
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him, but she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman; she loves her good timin' man

CHORUS
