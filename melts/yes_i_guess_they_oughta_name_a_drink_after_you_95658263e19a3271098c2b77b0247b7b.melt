Intro:
E   A

 
   A
Oh I get drunk most every night
D
Seems like all we do is fight
    A
The more I drink
                E
The less I feel blue
    A
Sometimes I feel like an awful fool
D
Spendin' my life on an old bar stool
    A                E                         A
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you


Break:
E       D
E       A


A
If this date were to be our last
D
I'd never sit down this glass
     A
It'd take all the booze in the world
          E
To forget you
       A
You've left my heart a vacant lot
D
I'll fill it with another shot
    A                E                         A
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you


Break:
E       D
E       A


A
Looks like I had my fill
D
Guess I better pay my bill
       A                                  E
When I started out I only meant to have a few
    A
Someone just said that you left town
D
I better get a double round
    A                E                         A
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
A                E                         A
Yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
