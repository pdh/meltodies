Verse 1:
         F
	Living on free food tickets

	Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
                   D#
	Where the rain came through
                     Bb       C/G
	What can you do? hmm hmm


Verse 2:
         F
	Tears from little sister

	Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress
	                         D#
	Without a patch for the party to go
                     Bb            C/G
	Oh but you know,she'll get by


Chorus:
    C/G         F                         Bb        F
	She is living in the love of the common people
	                            Bb    C/G
	Smiles from the heart of a family man
         F                        Bb       F
	Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
                                                   C/G         F
	Mamma's gonna love her just as much as she can,as she can


Verse 3: (a tone higher)
                G
	It's a good thing you don't have bus fare

	It would fall through the hole in your pocket
                                   F
	And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
                      C/G            D
	A walkin' to town to find a job


Verse 4:
          G
	Trying to keep your hands warm

	But the hole in your shoe let the snow come through
	          F
	And the chills to the bone
	                  C/G             D
	Oh,you better go home where it's warm


Chorus bis:
    D                  G                      C/G       G
	Where you can live in the love of the common people
                                    C/G    D
	Smiles from the heart of a family man
         G                       C/G       G
	Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
                                                    D          G
	Mamma's gonna love her just as much as she can,as she can


Verse 5: (a tone higher)
         A
	Living on dreams ain't easy

	But the closer the knit,the tighter the fit
                  G
	And the chills stay away
                            D            E
	You take them in stride,family pride


Verse 6:
                        A
	You know that faith is your foundation

	And with whole lotta love and a warm conversation
              G
	And plenty of prayer
                      D                E
	Making you strong,where you belong


Chorus ter:
    E                  A                       D        A
	Where you can live in the love of the common people
                                        D      E
	Be the pride in the heart of a family man
         A                        D        A
	Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
                                                    E          A
	Mamma's gonna love her just as much as she can,as she can
