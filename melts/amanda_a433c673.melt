                        AMANDA                        by          Waylon Jennings


1ST VERSE
     A               D               A
I've held it all in, Lord knows I've tried

            A                    E             A
But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life

   A                     D        A
To look in the mirror in total surprise

       A                         E         A
At the hair on my collar and the age in my eyes.


CHORUS
 A      D           A
Amanda, light of my life

A                           E           A
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife

 A      D           A
Amanda, light of my life

A                           E           A
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife

2ND VERSE
It's a measure of people who don't understand
The pleasures of life in a Hillbilly band.
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm pushing 30(?), still wearing jeans.
