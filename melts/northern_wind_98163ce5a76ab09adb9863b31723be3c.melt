Cat Stevens 1967 (New Masters Album )

D G D

D          G                        D     A
There is a wind, my Billy, and it's awful strong
   G                     D           G
Come for you, and anyone who's helped you along.

              A                                        G
But I want to live, live, live and let the stars shine bright
               D                                A
yes, I want to live, live, live and let it on alright

F#m           G                                D
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
                    A                                 G
I don't want to fight it, Billy, 'cause I want to go

G                  C                         D        C     (Billy, Billy)
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change
      D        C                                   D     F
and a Northern wind , Billy, really makin' me feel kinda strange (Billy, Billy)
          G        F                         G        F
there's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change (Billy, Billy)
      G        F                                  G     A
and a Northern wind, Billy, really makin' me feel kinda strange

              G                     D       A
And with this gun goes everything I want to say
        G                       D         G
Not for you, but for anyone who takes it away
                A                                      G
Let it fill his life, life, life until there's nothing left
                D                                 A
Let it kill his wife, wife, wife until he goes to bed

F#m           G                                D
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
                    A                                 G
I don't want to fight it, Billy, 'cause I want to go

G                  C                         D        C     (Billy, Billy)
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change
      D        C                                   D     F
and a Northern wind , Billy, really makin' me feel kinda strange (Billy, Billy)
