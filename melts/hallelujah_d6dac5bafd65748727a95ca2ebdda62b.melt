Hallelujah chords 
Leonard Cohen (live London version)

C Am C Am C Am C Am

         C                 Am
Now I've heard there was a secret chord,
     C                    Am
that David played, and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C       G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   C                  F           G
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth,
    Am              F
the minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em          Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     C G C    G
Hallelu  jah

     C                        Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof,
    C               Am
you saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G             C         G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    C             F       G
She tied you to a kitchen chair,
    Am                         F
she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    G                  Em            Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     C G C    G
Hallelu  jah

     C               Am
Now, maybe there's a God above,
    C          Am
and all I ever learned from love,
    F               G              C        G
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
     C                 F       G
It's not a cry you can hear at night,
     Am                 F
it's not somebody who's seen the light,
       G               Em          Am
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     C G C    G
Hallelu  jah

    C                 Am      
Oh, people, I ve been here before,
  C                    Am
I know this room, I've walked this floor
  F             G             C        G
I used to live alone before I knew you.
     C                     F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Am            F
Love is not a victory march
       G               Em          Am
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     C G C    G
Hallelu  jah

            C        Am
There was a time you let me know,
       C            Am
what's really going on below
    F             G              C       G
But now you never show it to me, do you?
      C             F        G
And remember when I moved in you
    Am            F
The holy dove was moving too
    G               Em            Am
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     C G C    G
Hallelu  jah

     C                Am
I ve done my best, it wasn't much,
  C                   Am
I couldn't feel, so I learned to touch
     F                        G       C       G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     G             Em              Am
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     C G C    G
Hallelu  jah

     F
Hallelujah
     Am
Hallelujah
     F
Hallelujah
     C G C    G
Hallelu  jah
