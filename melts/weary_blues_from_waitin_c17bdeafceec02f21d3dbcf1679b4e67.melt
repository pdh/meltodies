Chorus:

E       A        E
Weary blues from waiting
               F#7         B7
Lord I've been waiting too long
      E          A      E
These blues have got me crying
               B7          E
Oh sweet mamma please come home

 

    E          A         E
The snow falls around my window
    A                 E
But it can't chill my heart
    A                 E
God knows it died the day you left
               B7    E
My dream world fell apart

 

(Repeat Chorus)

 

        E       A           E
Through tears I watch young lovers
   A                 E
As they go strolling by
   A                   E
Oh all the things that might have been
               B7   E
God forgive me if I cry

 

(Repeat Chorus)
