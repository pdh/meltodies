************* ARMED AND DANGEROUS *************

written by Troy Seals and Tony Colton-Chalk

performed by Waylon Jennings


Verse 1:
         E
	Ran my Chevy through the car wash

	Threw the beers cans out

	Emptied all the ash trays

	Cleaned a little house
                A
	Got my Allman Brothers cassettes

	Stacked up on the dash
                  B
	Got some jack back in the trunk
                            E
	And a tank full of gas


Verse 2:
          E
	Stopped and bought some roses

	To sweep you off your feet

	Yes i'm going for the limit,girl

	I'm gettin' in the real deep
              A
	Dusted off my Dingos

	Got my Levis pressed
                B
	Gonna break into your heart
                               E
	And steal what i love best


Chorus:
             E
	Yes i'm armed and dangerous
          D              A               E
	Woman you've made me a desperate man

	Armed and dangerous
          D              A           E
	Comin' for your lovin' yes i am


Verse 3:
          E
	Take a ride out in the country

	Where the grass is tall and cool

	And do some barefoot dancin'

	How's that sound to you
                 A
	And i've got some other things

	That i might suggest
                  B
	But if i put them on this record
                        E
	I'd be under arrest


Chorus (x2).
