Finger pick or strum these chords it sounds great and the song is a gem. 

More people should hear this one that's why I tabbed it out.

Capo 4th fret - Intro is the same chords as verse

Today I walked down the street I use to wander
               C                      G

I bronzed my shoes and hung from a rearview mirror
           C                              G
Bronzed admiration in the blind spot of regret

There was all these things that I don't think I remember
