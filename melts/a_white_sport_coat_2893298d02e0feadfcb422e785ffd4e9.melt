A WHITE SPORT COAT  (AND A PINK CARNATION)
By : Marty Robbins
Recorded in Db

Tabbed in "C"

INTRO:

C  - Dm  - G

VERSE ONE         
   C                     Dm        G    G-F#-F
A white sport coat and a pink car-nation 
F               G           C
I'm all dressed up for the dance. 
   C                     Dm        G    G-F#-F 
A white sport coat and a pink car-nation, 
F        G        C
I'm all alone in romance.

BRIDGE
G                                            
Once you told me long ago
C                              
..to the prom with me you'd go, 
D7                
..now you've changed your mind, it seems 
 G                  G7
..someone else will hold my dreams.

F        G            C   G#7 (key change)
And in a blue...blue mood
