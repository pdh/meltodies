I Shall Be Released chords
Bob Dylan  *

A                            Bm
They say everything can be replaced
C#m       Bm              A   E7
Yet every distance is not near
A                   Bm
So I remember every face
C#m      Bm             A   E7
Of every man who put me here.

A                   Bm
I see my light come shining
C#m      Bm            A
From the west unto the east.
A
Any day now,
Bm
Any day now,
C#m Bm         A
I   shall be released

A                           Bm
They say every man needs protection.
C#m            Bm       A   E7
They say every man must fall.
A                      Bm
Yet I swear I see my reflection,
C#m          Bm             A   E7
Somewhere so high above the wall.

A                   Bm
I see my light come shining
C#m      Bm            A
From the west unto the east.
A
Any day now,
Bm
Any day now,
C#m Bm         A
I   shall be released

A                                Bm
Well yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
C#m       Bm               A   E7
A man who swears he not to blame.
A                           Bm
All day long I hear him cry shouting loud,
C#m         Bm             A   E7
Calling out that he's been framed.

A                   Bm
I see my light come shining
C#m      Bm            A
From the west unto the east.

A
Any day now,
Bm
Any day now,
C#m Bm         A
I   shall be released
