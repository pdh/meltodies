VERSE 1 
          G                D  
It’s not time to make a  change,
        C           Am                  G        
Just relax, take it easy, you’re still young
            Em                Am                D
That’s your fault, there's so much you have to know.
       G            D            C             Am
Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry.
        G        Em          Am     D
Look at me, I am old but I’m happy. 
      G                 D
I was once like you are now,
        C                Am        
And I know that it's not easy
      G                Em              Am         D
To be calm when you've found something going on,
              G              D
But take your time, think a lot, 
      C                         Am         
Why, think of everything you've got
              G                 Em
For you will still be here to - morrow
          Am         G
But your dreams may not.

VERSE 2

How can I try to exp - lain,
            C                   Am
'cause when I do he turns away again,
      G               Em             C       D
It’s always been the same, same old story.
         G               D           C         Am             
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen,
              G         Em           Am      G 
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
    D        C        G   
I know, I   have to   go.

'cause when I do he turns away again,
      E               C#m            A       B
It’s always been the same, same old story.
         E               B           A         F#m
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen,
