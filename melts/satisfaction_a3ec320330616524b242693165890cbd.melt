Satisfaction
        E              A
Chorus:  I can't get no satisfaction
        E              A
         I can't get no satisfaction
                   E          H7         E          A
         Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try.
                  E     A         E
         I can't get no, I can't get no

    A           E             A
     When I'm drivin' in my car
               E                 A
     And that man comes on the radio
                  E                  A
     And he's tellin' me more and more
                E              A
     about some useless information,
                  E              A
     Supposed to fire my imagination
              E     A             E
     I can't get no. Oh, no, no, no
                  A              E  A
     Hey, hey, hey that' what I say.

Chorus

     When I'm watchin' my TV
     And that man comes on to tell me
     How white my shirts can be
     Well, he can't be a man
     'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me.
     I can't get no. Oh, no, no, no
     Hey, hey, hey that' what I say.

Chorus

     When I'm ridin' 'round the world
     And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
     And I'm tryin' to make some girl
     Who tells me, baby, better come back letter
     next week, 'cos you see I'm on losing streak
     I can't get no. Oh, no, no, no
     Hey, hey, hey that' what I say.

       A         E     A         E
Chorus: I can't get no, I can't get no.
       A         E    A      E
        I can't get no satisfaction
       A         E
        no satisfaction,
        no satisfaction,
        no satisfaction
