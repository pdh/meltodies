Subject: CRD: Georgia On My Mind

Willie Nelson recorded this song in the key of C#.  I transposed

it to the key of C.  Please send me e-mail if any of the chords do

not sound right to you.  (This is my first posting to any newsgroup,

so I apologize in advance if I'm not doing it right.)

Verse:

C?       E7?    Am7?  G7?       F?       F#dim?                      ?

Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through

        C?        Edim?      Dm7?  G7?        E7? A7? ?D7?  G7?

just an old sweet song keeps Georgia    on my mind

C?       E7?    Am7?  G7?     F?   F#dim?                            ?

Georgia, Georgia,   a song of you

      C?        Edim?    Dm7?    G7?           C?   F?  C?  E7?      ?

Comes sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines

Bridge:

Am7?  Dm7?       Am7?   F?                                           ?

Other arms reach out to me

Am7?  Dm7?   Am7?      D7?                                           ?

Other eyes smile tenderly

Am7?  F?            C?       Bdim?   Am7?       C#dim?  Dm7?   G7?    ?

  Still in peaceful dreams I see the road leads back to you

Verse:

C?       E7?    Am7?  G7?       F?  F#dim?                    ?

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find

         C?        Edim?      Dm7?  G7?         C?   F?  C? G7?

just and old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
