VERSE:
             F
      Well, baby used to stay out all night long
      She made me cry, she done me wrong
      She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
      Tables turning, now it's her turn to cry


CHORUS:
                 C
      Because I used to love her
    Bb                   F
      But it's all over now
                 C
      Because I used to love her 
    Bb                   F
      But it's all over now


VERSE:
      Well, she used to run around with every man in town
      Spent all my money playin' a high-class game
      She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
      The tables turning, now it's her turn to cry
 

CHORUS:
      Because I used to love her
      But it's all over now
      Because I used to love her
      But it's all over now


INSTRUMENTAL:  SOLO OVER CHORUS CHORDS -- 3x's


VERSE:
      Well, I used to wake up in the morning
      Get my breakfast in bed
      When I gotten worried
      She could ease my aching head
      But now she's here and there 
      With every man in town
      Instead of trying to take me
      For that same old clown
     

CHORUS:
      Because I used to love her
      But it's all over now

      Because I used to love her
      But it's all over now

      Because I used to love her
      But it's all over now
