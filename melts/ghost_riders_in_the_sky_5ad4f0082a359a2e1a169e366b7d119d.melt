Ghost Riders in the Sky





	First off, if you want just a simple version, ignore all the chords
in parentheses, and simply play the Em, G and C where indicated.  Strum in
a rythm that sounds like a galloping horse; you know, like the first few
opening bars to the theme from Bonanza (tum tada dum tada dum tada dum).

	On the other hand, you can make this simple song more interesting
with a few easy tricks.  The first is to play the bass line along with the
Em chord.  The bass line is easy, and goes...

E|----------------------------------
B|----------------------------------
G|----------------------------------
D|----------------------------------
A|-----1-2------1-2-------1-2-------
E|--0-------0---------0---------0---

...where the open sixth string (E) is a quarter note, the two notes on the
fifth string (Bb abd B, repectively) are eighth notes.  If you play the Em
chord as...

EADGBe
||1|||
|23|||
||||||

...(Yes, that's right; two fingers on the fifth string), you can play the
bass line while you strum the Em chord just by picking up and putting
down your 3rd finger.

	The changes to (C/E) and (A/E) are attempts to cover the sound
originally filled in by a couple of background singers singing "ah" on the
notes B, C, C#, C.  This works on acoustic guitar if you continue to strum
the low E (open sixth string) rather prominantly while playing the
following positions.

C/E   (regular old C position,      A/E    or A7/E
EADGBe but with the low E played  EADGBe    EADGBe  (i.e., use your third
||||1| with a vengeance!)         ||||||    ||||||   finger to mute the
||2|||                            ||111|    ||||1|   4th string.  I prefer
|3||||                            ||||||    ||||||   this because the 
                                  |3||||    |3x|||   changes are smoother)

Good luck.  Send email or post if you have any questions.

"Ghost Riders in the Sky"

Em                                 G
An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
  Em 
Upon a ridge he rested as he went upon his way
     Em           (C/E)          (A/E)            (C/E)
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
C                        (Am)      Em
Coming through the ragged sky, and up a cloudy draw


      Em                                  G
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
      Em
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
  Em                (C/E)               (A/E)               (C/E)
A bolt of fear went through him as they rumbled through the sky
        C                          (Am)        Em
Then he saw the riders coming hard,     and he heard their mournful cry

(Chorus) 
         G             Em   (D)
Yippe-ai-ay, yippee-ai-oh
C           (Am)    Em
Ghost riders in the sky


       Em                         G
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
       Em                                                    
If you want to save your soul from hell, a riding on this range
     Em                (C/E)         (A/E)            (C/E)
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
C                              (Am)    Em
Trying to catch the devil's herd,    across these endless skies
