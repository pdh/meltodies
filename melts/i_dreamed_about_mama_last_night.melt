Intro:
D7   G


     G                        C          G
I've just been to heaven with someone so true 
  D7                      G
I dreamed about mama last night
    G                          C       G
She read me the Bible like she used to do 
  D7                      G
I dreamed about mama last night



[SPOKEN] - Just Repeat /G    C  G/  /D7    G/

She never close her eyes to sleep till we were all in bed
and on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away

we only knew she never slept and when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key

for always when we'd step inside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight

she had to know we were safe before she went to rest 
for she seemed to fear the world might harm the ones she loved best
and once she said when you have grown into woman and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then

And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
then came the night that we were called to gather roun her bed
The children're all with you now the kindly doctor said

and in her eyes there gleamed again that old time tender light
that told she'd been waitin just to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years tand then she went to sleep

   G                        C           G
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep 
  D7                      G
I dreamed about mama last night
