Stand Alone

C		   Am
There you are, cryin' again
	   F		        G
But your loveliness won't cover your shame
C		          Am
There you are, you're takin' true love
		     F			   G
And while you're takin' true love, you given the blame

F			        G
(How could I ...) Could I be so wrong
C		           Am
To think that we could get along?
F		G
Days I wasted with you, child
C			       Am
If I count there'll be a million or two
      F			      C
Now I stand alone through the memories
     G
That haunts me, that haunt
	      F			     C	
Yeah, and I walk alone through the rhapsodies
	G
That taunts me, that taunts me, me
