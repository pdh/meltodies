             E           E7 
We are young country
           A
We are the pride
                  B
The sons and the daughters
            E
Of American life

                         E7 
Our hair is not orange
                         A

We don't wear chains and spikes
                   D               A
But we know how to have fun
              A
Come Saturday night

               A
We know what's right
               E
We know what's wrong
                B
We know what we like
               E 
To hear in our songs

                    A
We like some of the old stuff
                    E
We like some of the new
                  D   
But we do our own choosin'
                A
We pick our own music
                        E
If you dont mind, thank you

            E
We are youg country
            A
We like all kinds
             B
Of music and people
                         E
'Cause we don't draw no lines
                                   E7
No, our hair is not orange
                         A
We don't wear chains and spikes
                   D               A
But we know how to have fun
              E
On a Saturday night


F              Bb 
   We like old Waylon
            F
We Know Van Halen
           C
We like ZZ Top
                    F
We like country and rock

                  Bb
Old Hank would be proud
                F
And Elvis would too
                   Eb
'Cause we like our country
Bb                       F
Mixed with some big city blues

---------N.C.-------------
We are young country
We are the pride
The sons and the daughters
Of American life

  Old Hank would be proud
F7                Bb
  And Elvis would too
                   Eb
'Cause we like our country
Bb                        F
Mixed with some rythm and blues

        Eb
We know when it's hot
                  Bb
We know when it's not
                         F
If you don't mind, thank you
