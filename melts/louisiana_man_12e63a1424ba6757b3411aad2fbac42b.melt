(G)Mmm- bop-bop-bomm-bah, bah-bop-bahmm-bah-bah.
mmm- bop-bop-bom-bah, bah-bop-(D)bah- buh- bop-(G)bahmmm

(G) At birth mom and papa called their little boy Ned
They raised him on the banks of the (D) river (G) bed
Houseboat tied to a big tall tree 
A home for my mama and my (D) papa and (G) me

The clock strikes three, papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cookin' papa (D) somethin' to (G) eat
At half past, papa he's ready to go
He hops in his pirogue, headed (D) down the bay-(G)-ou

He's got (C) fishin' lines strung across the Louisiana River
Gotta catch a big fish for (G) us to (C) eat
Settin' traps in the swamp catchin' anythin' he can
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin' he's a (G) Louisiana (C) man

(G) Muskrat hides  hangin' by the dozen
Even got a lady make a (D) muskrat (G) cousin
Got 'em out dryin' in the hot, hot sun
Tomorrow papa's gonna turn 'em (D) into (G) mon

(G)Mmm- bop-bop-bomm-bah, bah-bop-bahmm-bah-bah.
mmm- bop-bop-bom-bah, bah-bop-(D)bah- buh- bop-(G)bahmmm

(G) They call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
A little baby brother on the (D) floor that's (G) Mac
Brynn and Lynn are the family twins
Big brother Ed's on the (D) bayou (G) fishin'

On the river floats papa's great big boat
And that's how my papa goes (D) into (G) town
Takes ev'ry bit of the night and the day
To even reach a place where the (D) people (G) stay

(C) But I can hardly wait 'til tomorrow comes around
That's the day my pappy takes his (G) furs to (C) town
Papa promised me Ned and I could go
Even let me see a (G) cowboy (C) show

(G) Cowboys and Indians for the first time then
I told my papa, gotta (D) go a-(G)-gain
Papa said, son we got the lines to run
We'll come back but now there's (D) work to be (G) done

He's got (C) fishin' line strung across the Louisiana River
Gota catch a big fish for (G) us to (C) eat
Settin' traps in the swamps catchin' anythin' he can
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Gota make a livin' he's a (G) Louisiana (C) man

(G)Mmm- bop-bop-bomm-bah, bah-bop-bahmm-bah-bah.
mmm- bop-bop-bom-bah, bah-bop-(D)bah- buh- bop-(G)bahmmm
