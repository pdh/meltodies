Johnny Yuma was a rebel, he roamed through the west,

Did Johnny Yuma the rebel, he wandered a-lone.

            F#m                    C#m
He got fightin' mad, this rebel lad.
      A 
He packed no star as he wandered far
                  D
Where the only law was a hook and a draw.
        A
The rebel Johnny Yuma.

            A                  D            E                             A
Johnny Yuma was a rebel, he roamed through the west,
                                    D           E                  A
Did Johnny Yuma the rebel, he wandered a-lone.

      F#m                             C#m
He searched the land, this restless lad.
                A
He was a panther quick and leather tough
        D
If he figured that he'd been pushed enugh.
       A
The rebel Johnny Yuma.
              C

Am                       Em
Fightin' mad, this rebel lad.

With a dream he'd hold till his dyin' breath,
         F
He'd search his soul and gamble with death.
       C
The rebel Johnny Yuma.
