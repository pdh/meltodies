                          C
Take the ribbon from your hair
                          F     Dm
Shake it loose and let it fall
                    G 
Layin` soft upon my skin
                        C 
Like the shadows on the wall.


                        C
Come and lay down by my side
                        F     Dm          
‘Till the early morning light
                       G                            
All I’m taking is your time
                            C                  
Help me make it through the night.

                            F
I don’t care who`s right or wrong
                     C
I don`t try to understand
                     D
Let the devil take tomorrow
                         G
‘Lord, tonight I need a friend

                      C
Yesterday is dead and gone
                      F       Dm  
And tomorrow`s out of sight
                    G
And it’s sad to be alone
                             C   
Help me make it through the night.


(instr)   C       F   Dm
                     G
Lord it’s sad to be alone
                            C
Help me make it through the night.
