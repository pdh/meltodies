*************** BILLY DEE ****************

written and performed by Kris Kristofferson


Verse 1:
          G                               C/G          G
	Billy Dee was seventeen when he turned twenty-one
                                                 D
	Fooling with some foolish things he could've left alone
            G                            C/G               G
	But he had to try to satisfy a thirst he couldn't name
                                            D            G
	Driven towards the darkness by the devil in his veins
              C/G                     G
	All around the honky tonks,searching for a sign
                                        D
	Gettin' by on gettin' high on women,words and wine
              G                               C/G               G
	Some folks called him crazy,Lord,and others called him free
                                           D              G
	But we just called us lucky for the love of Billy Dee


Verse 2:(Three and a half tones lower)
          C/G                        F               C/G
	Busy goin' his own way and speakin' his own words
                                       G
	Facin' and forgettin' every warnin' that he heard
         C/G                            F              C/G
	Makin' friends and takin' any crazy chance he could
                                         G                     C/G
	Gettin' busted for the bad times and believin' in the good
          F                           C/G
	Billy took a beatin' from a world he meant no harm
                                       G
	The score was written in the scars up on his arm
              C/G                      F                  C/G
	Some felt he was payin' for the life he tried to lead
                                           G                C/G
	But all we felt was sorry for our good friend Billy Dee


Verse 3:(Four and a half tones higher)
            A                           D             A
	It may be his soul bigger than a body's oughta be
                                                    E
	Singin' songs and bringin' laughter to the likes of you and me
           A                                     D                  A
	Cause the world he saw was sadder than the one he hoped to find
                                          E                 A
	But it wasn't near as lonesome as the one he left behind
             D                           A
	Yesterday they found him on the floor of his hotel
                                              E
	Reachin' towards the needle,Lord,that drove him down to hell
              A                         D               A
	Some folks called it suicide,others blame the speed
                                          E             A
	But we all called it crucified when Billy Dee O.D.'d
