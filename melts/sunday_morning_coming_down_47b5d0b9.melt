/************** SUNDAY MORNIN' COMIN' DOWN *************/

written and performed by Kris Kristofferson.

Capo on the first fret.

Verse 1:
	       G
	Well I woke up Sunday morning
	       C			G
	with no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt

	and the beer I had for breakfast
                     Em			      D
	wasn't bad so I had one more for dessert


Verse 2:
	       G
	Than I fumble through my closet for
                                            C                                             G
	my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
				  Em
	and I shaved my face and combed my hair
				           D
	and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

Verse 3:
	       G
	I'd smoked my brain the night before
	       C                                                          G
	and cigarettes and songs that I've been pickin'
				       Em
	but I lit my first and watched a small kid
			               D
	cussin' at a can that he was kicking


Verse 4:
	       G
	Then I crossed the empty street and caught
	       C			      G
	the sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken

	and it took me back to somethin' that
	      Em		         D
        I'd lost somehow somewhere along away


Chorus:
	 /		          C
	On a sunday mornin' sidewalks
			       G
	wishing Lord that I was stoned
			                       D
	'cause there is something in a sunday
			G
	that makes a body feel alone

        			   C
	And there's nothin' short of dyin'
			         G
	half as lonesome as the sound
			       D
	on the sleepin' city side walks
			        G
	Sunday mornin' comin' down


Verse 5:
	      G
	In the park I saw a daddy with
	      C			  G
	a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
				Em
	and I stopped beside a sunday school
			                        D
	and listened to the song that they were singin'


Verse 6:
	       G
	Then I headed back for home and
	       C			      G
	somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
				  Em
	and it echoed thru the canyon like
	       			   D
	the disepparing dreams of yesterday.

Thanks to Jan Ekeland for the lyrics.

 C
Well I woke up Sunday morning
        F                                 C
with no way to hold my head that it didn't hurt
                                          Am
and the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
                          G     G7    C     G7
so I had one more for dessert
            C
Then I fumbled through my closet
            F                                C     Am
for my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
            F               G7
and I shaved my face and I combed my hair and
      F                              G7
stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

      C
I smoked my brain the night before
            F                             C
with cigarettes and songs that I had been pickin'
       C
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
 Am                           G     G7    C     G7
cussin' at a can that he was kickin'
         C
And I crossed the empty street
                  F                             C     Am
and caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
            F                 G7
And it took me back to somethin'
             F                G7          C
that I 'd lost somewhere somehow along the way

                        F
On the Sunday mornin' sidewalk
                        C
wishin' Lord that I was stone
                              G7
'cause there's somethin' in Sunday
                        C     C7
that makes a body feel alone
                              F
and there's nothing short of dyin'
                        C
half as lonesome as the sound
                        G           G7    F
of a sleepin' city sidewalk
            G7          C
Sunday mornin' comin' down


In the park I saw a daddy
            F                             C
with a laughing little girl that he was swingin'

and I stopped beside a Sunday school
      Am                                  G     G7    C     G7
and listened to the songs that they were singin'
      C
and I headed back for home
                  F                       C     Am
and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
        F                     G7
and it echoed through the canyon
            F           G7          C
like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
