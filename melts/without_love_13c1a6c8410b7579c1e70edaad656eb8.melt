Intro:

|     G     |     C     |     G     |     G     |
|     G     |     D     |     G     |     G     |

              G      C                G
Without love,     I am half human.
              Em    D                         G
Without love,       I'm all machine.
                     C                        G     Em
Without love,    there's nothin' do - in'.
          G    D               G
I will die        without love.

              G       C               G
Without love,        I am an island,
                  Em    D                             G
All by my-self            in a heartbreak sea.
                     C                           G    Em 
Without love,        there's no de-ny - in'.
         G           D              G
I am       dyin'     without love.

       D
For there is nowhere I can run
A                        D
And threre is no hiding place.

Stickin' out like a sore thumb
A                       D                    C
By that gloomy look upon my face.

              G      C                  G
Without love,      I'm incom - plete.
              Em     D                G
Without love,        I am not whole.
                      C                     G        Em
Without love,       I'm barely on my feet.
         G           D              G
I am       dyin'     without love.

Instrumental verse

       D
For there is nowhere I can run
A                        D
And threre is no hiding place.

Stickin' out like a sore thumb
A                       D                    C
By that gloomy look upon my face.

              G      C                   G
Without love,       I'm incom - plete.
              Em       D                G
Without love,          I am not whole.
                       C                     G        Em
Without love,        I'm barely on my feet.
         G           D              G
I am       dyin'     without love.
         G           D              G
I am       dyin'     without love.
