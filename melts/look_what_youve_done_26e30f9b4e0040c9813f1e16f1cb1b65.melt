Look What You ve Done chords
The Rolling Stones

Open or Capo III

A  B7 A E  B7

                     E
Now look what you've done,

now look what you've done
                 A
Look what you've done baby,
                     E
now look what you've done
            B7
You left me here,
           A
the lonely one
              B7
And all I can say,
                    E   B7
is look what you've done 

         E
A broken heart,

a worried mind
           A
Because of you baby,
              E
dying all the time
             B7
I once had a dream,
             A
but now I've none
                 B7
Your taking your love,
                E   B7
and see what it done 

E A E B7 A B7 E   B7

          E
I saw you last night,
        
out moving round
          A
With your new turf,
              E
you paint the town
         B7
That is OK,
                   A
you're having your fun
             B7
Because some day,
              E   B7
they call you done 

             E
And now your bird cries,

the shadow falls
       A
Gloomy memories,
        E
and I recall
                B7
Your love is my life,
               A
as warm as the sun
              B7
But now it is gone,
                E   A  E7
and see what it done
