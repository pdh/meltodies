Stand By Your Man Chords              Patsy Cline


G                           D
Sometimes it´s hard to be a woman,
Am              D7               G
giving all your love to just one man.
C                            G
You´ll have bad times, and he´ll have good times,
A                 A7             D     D7
doing things that you don´t understand.

G                             D
But if you love him you´ll forgive him,
Am               D7           G
even though he´s hard to understand.
C                          G
And if you love him, oh be proud of him,
D7                            G    C G D
´cause after all he´s just a man.

G             B7   C
Stand by your man, give him two arms to cling to,
G            E
and somthing warm to come to,
A                   D7
when the nights are cold and lonly.
G             B7   C
Stand by your man, and tell the world you love him,
G           D7               B7  E C     D       G    C G D
keep giving all the love you can.  Stand by your man.


G             B7   C
Stand by your man, and tell the world you love him,
G           D7               B7  E C     D       G
keep giving all the love you can.  Stand by your man.
