Half as Much by Hank Williams

D
If you love my half as much as I love you
                                  A
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
            D                       G
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
               E              A
You only build me up to let me down

D
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
                                   A
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
          D               G
I know that I would never feel so blue
         A                      D
If you only loved me half as much as I love you

repeat both verses
