Bob Dylan 1989

Capo II

G D 3x

D                     G            D    G D
What good am I if I m like all the rest?
                            G              D       G D
If I just turn away, when I see how you re dressed
     Bm          D          Bm             D
If I shut myself off so,  I can t hear you cry
G    D    G  D   G D
What good am I?

D                   G              D   G D
What good am I if I know and don t do?
                             G                  D   G D
If I see and don t say, if I look right through you
     Bm          D           G          D
If I turn a deaf ear, to the thundering sky
G    D    G  D   G D
What good am I?

D                    G          D    G D
What good am I while you softly weep?
                               G           D     G D
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
      Bm            D                 Bm             D
And I freeze in the moment,  like the rest who don t try
G    D    G  D   G D
What good am I?

     Bm        D         Bm         D
What good am I then,  to others and me?
        Bm        D               Bm            D
If I ve had every chance, and yet still fail to see?
   Bm           D                Bm         D
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
    Bm            D       G                 Em
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?

D                   G           D       G D
What good am I if I say foolish things?
                           G           D      G D
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
      Bm           D               Bm       D
And I just turn my back, while you silently die
G    D    G  D   G D
What good am I?

G D . . .
