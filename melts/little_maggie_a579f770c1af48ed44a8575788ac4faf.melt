Little Maggie (Bob Dylan Version)

Tuning: Standard (Capo 2nd fret)

Transcribed by DWdrummer67. Please rank this contribution. Thanks.

This is a really cool version from Bob Dylan's "Good As I Been To You" CD.
It was a little tricky to transcribe, but I think it's pretty close. Enjoy!

Am2                   G   E7       G    D C  Am2
Oh, where is little Maggie, over yonder she stands
Am2             G    E7       G     D  C  Am2
Rifle on her shoulder, six shooter in her hand

How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Shinin' like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky
 
Rather be in some lonely hollow, where the sun don't ever shine
Than to see you be another man's darling, and to know that you'll never be mine
 
Am2, G, E7, G, D, C, Am2
Am2, G, E7, G, D, C, Am2

Well, it's march me away to the station, with my suitcase in my hand
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far-distant land
 
Am2, G, E7, G, D, C, Am2

Sometimes I have a nickel, and sometimes I have a dime
Sometimes I have ten dollars, just to pay for little Maggie's wine
 
Am2, G, E7, G, D, C, Am2

Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine
Pretty girls are made for boy's love, little Maggie was made for mine
 
Am2, G, E7, G, D, C, Am2

Well, yonder stands little Maggie, with a dram glass in her hand
She's a drinkin' down her troubles, over courtin' some other man

Am2, G, E7, G, D, C, Am2
Am2, G, E7, G, D, C, Am2
