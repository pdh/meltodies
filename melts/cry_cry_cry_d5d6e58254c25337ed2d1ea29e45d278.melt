 G - A - D ~
 
               D
1. Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down,
                                                     E           A
    I think you only live to see the lights uptown.
        D
    I wasted my time when I would try, try, try,
                    G                                                            A            D
    'cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry.
 
       D
2. Soon your sugar daddies will all be gone,
                                                            E                 A
    you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
               D
    You'll call for me, but I'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye,
                 G                                                   A           D
    when I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry.
 
                           D                                        D7
    You're gonna cry, cry, cry, and you'll cry alone,
               G                                                D
    when everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own,
                           A    G    D
    you're gonna cry, cry, cry.

3. I lie awake at night to wait till you come in,
                                                                  E        A
    you stay a little while and then you're gone again.
                  D
    Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie,
           G                                              A           D
    for every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                        D
4. When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you,
                                                                  E                A
    then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
         D
    I'll tell you “no”, and then you'll ask me why, why, why,
             G                                                 A           D
    when I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.
 
                           D                                                  D7
    You're gonna cry, cry, cry, and you'll want me then,
           G                                       D
    it'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been,
                           A    G    D
    you're gonna cry, cry, cry.
 
+ G - A - D
