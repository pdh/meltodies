South Of The Border
Recorded by Patsy Cline
Written by Michael Carr and Jimmy Kennedy

G        D7           G
Ay ay ay ay  ay ay ay ay  

                         D7     G
South of the border down Mexico way
                                                     D7
That's where they fell in love when stars above came out to play
                G                          C
And now as they wander their thoughts ever stray
             G           D7     G
South of the border down Mexico way

                     D7          G
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
                                            D7
Just for a tender while he kissed the smile upon her face
           G                       C
For it was Fiesta and they were so gay
             G           D7     G
South of the border down Mexico way

                                 Am
Then she sighed as she whispered mananna 
      D7                      G
Never dreaming that they were parting
                  E7        Am
And he lied as he whispered mananna
         G        D7    G
For that tomorrow never came

                       D7            G
South of the border he rode back one day
                                            D7
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
                  G                        C
The mission bells told him that he mustn't stay
             G           D7     G
South of the border down Mexico way

         D7           G            D7           G
Ay ay ay ay  ay ay ay ay  ay ay ay ay  ay ay ay ay
