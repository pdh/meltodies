C                           G                 
Morning found me lyin' on a floor in New Orleans
C                            G                                        
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans
C                           G                  
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
      C                  D            G
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina


C                          G
Met her on an ocean liner, called her Cocaine Carolina
C                              G
She was quite a lady then, and I was twenty-two
C                                G
God knows how much I adored her, I just never could afford her
C                        D               G
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you


Chorus:
     C                       G                  
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
C                                   G
I'm going back to Sandy Skags, she knows just what to do
C                               G                     
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
C                         D                C                         
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you


   C                            G                
Oh someone said if I was lucky, I could go back to Kentucky
C                             G
Lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills
C                          G
Carolina we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up
C              G              D                             
Maybe I should go to California

Repeat chorus
