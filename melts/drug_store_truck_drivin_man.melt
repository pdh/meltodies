Chorus:
       C                        G
He's a drug store truck drivin' man
G                            C
He's the head of the Ku Klux Klan
C                          F
When summer comes rollin' around
F        G                   C
We'll be lucky to get out of town

Verse 1:
     C                     G
He's been like a father to me
G                             F          C
He's like the only DJ you can hear after three
C                                F
And I'm an all night singer in a country band
F   G                      F          C
And if he don't like me he don't understand

Chorus

Verse 2:
He's got him a house on the hill
And he can play country records till you've had your fill
And he's a law man's friend he's an all night DJ
Sure don't think much like the records he plays

Chorus

Verse 3:
He don't like resistance I know
And he said it last night on a big TV show
He's got him a medal that he won in the war
Weighs 500 pounds and it sleeps by the door

Chorus (repeat the last line once)
