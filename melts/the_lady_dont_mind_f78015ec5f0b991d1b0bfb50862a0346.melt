VERSE
Am                                         G
 Last time she jumped out the window, well, she only turned and smiled 
Am                                                 G
 You might think she would say something, but you'd have to wait a while


CHORUS
         Am
Well the lady don't mind
                G
No, no, no, the lady don't mind
        Am
She just turns her head and disappears,
 G
I kinda like that style


VERSE                                    
Am                                       G
 Little boat that floats on a river, it's drifting through a haze
Am                                         G
 She floats by whenever she wants to, well, there she goes again


CHORUS
              Am
Well, it's no trouble at all
           G
No, no, no trouble at all
     Am
Well, what she doesIs all right with me, 
   G                           [G G#]
And I kinda like that style


MIDDLE 8
Am
 Come on, come on, I go up and down
G
 I like this curious feeling 
Am
 I know, I see, it's like make believe 
G
 Cover your ears so you can hear what I'm saying
Am                                     G
 I'm not lost but I don't know where I am I got a question
Am
 All right, all right, this is what we like
G
 Who knows, who knows, what I'm thinking

VERSE
Am
 She says love is not what she's after, 
   G
And everyone knows
Am
 Each time she looks in the mirror,
G
 She lets her feelings show


CHORUS
         Am
Well the lady don't mind
                G
No, no, no, the lady don't mind
     Am
Well, what she says is all right by me,
   G                           [G G#]
And I kinda like that style


MIDDLE 8
Am
 Uh-oh, uh-oh, here we go again
G
 I don't know, I don't know what I'm sayin'
Am
 Hey man, hey man, I sure don't feel the same
G 
 She likes to say what she's feeling
Am                       G
 Hey, did I get a big surprise, I know you think so
Am
 Come on, come on, she says anything
G
 Who knows, who knows, what she's thinking
