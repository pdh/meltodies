    A             D                  A
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
    A                  D              A
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
    D                     A
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
E                           A
And long ago I stopped askin' why

A G  A  D

    A             D                  A
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you.
    A                  D              A
You've cut me and have scarred me thru an' thru.
    D                     A
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man;
E                                A
Mister Congressman why can't you understand.


A G  A  D


    A             D                  A
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
    A                  D              A
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
    D                     A
You bent my heart and mind and you rob my soul,
E                                           A
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold.



A G  A  D

    A             D                  A
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell.
    A                  D              A
May your walls fall and may I live to tell.
    D                     A
May all the world forget you ever stood.
E                           A         
And may all the world regret you did no good.

(2x) 
G                       A             D   
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me.
