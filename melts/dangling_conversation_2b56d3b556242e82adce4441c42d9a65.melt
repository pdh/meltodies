"The Dangling Conversation"
Simon &amp; Garfunkel
Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme

Capo on 1st fret.

Verse:

       D          A     E
It's a still life water color,

     D        A    E
Of a now late afternoon,

       D          A           E
As the sun shines through the curtained lace

    A                A6   Amaj7   A6
And shadows wash the room.


Chorus:

       F#m                      D/F#   F#m
And we sit and drink our coffee

G
Couched in our indifference,

     F#
Like shells upon the shore

        E
You can hear the ocean roar

       D        A     E
In The Dangling Conversation

        A    E      D
And the superficial sighs,

                   A      A6   Amaj7   A6
The borders of our lives.


Verse:

        D         A     E
And you read your Emily Dickinson,

    D    A      E
And I my Robert Frost,

       D        A          E
And we note our place with bookmarkers

     A                  A6   Amaj7   A6
That measure what we've lost.


Chorus:

       F#m                 D/F#    F#m
Like a poem poorly written

       G
We are verses out of rhythm,

F#
Couplets out of rhyme,

   E
In syncopated time

        D        A     E
And The Dangling Conversation

        A    E      D
And the superficial sighs,

                       A      A6   Amaj7   A6
Are the borders of our lives.


Verse:

        D        A           E
Yes, we speak of things that matter,

     D          A       E
With words that must be said,

      D   A      E
"Can analysis be worthwhile?"

        A              A6   Amaj7   A6
"Is the theater really dead?"


Chorus:

            F#m                  D/F#  F#m
And how the room is softly faded

      G
And I only kiss your shadow,

  F#
I cannot feel your hand,

         E
You're a stranger now unto me

            D        A     E
Lost in The Dangling Conversation

        A    E      D
And the superficial sighs,

                      A      A6   Amaj7   A6   A
In the borders of our lives.
