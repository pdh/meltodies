THE SILVER TOUNGED DEVIL AND I - Kris Kristoferson

   G                       G7
I took myself down to the Tally Ho Tavern
   C                  G
To buy me a bottle of beer
  C                    G            Em
I sat myself down by a tender young maiden
      C                        D7
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair
    G                          G7
And while I was searching from bottle to bottle
    C                       G
For something un-foolish to say
     C                         G                Em
That silver tounged devil just slipped from the shadows
    C         D7        G
And smilingly stole her away
               C                          G
chorus: I said girl don't you know he's a devil
        C                      G
        He's everything that I ain't
        C                    G    Em        C          D7
        Hiding intentions of evil under the smile of a saint
                 C                      G
        All he's good for is getting in trouble
            C                         G
        And slipping his share of the blame
            C                         G
        And some people swear he's my double
            C                       D7
        And some even say we're the same
                C                          G
        But the silver-tounged devil's got nothing to lose
            C                      G
        And I'll only live 'till I die
           C                        G           Em
        We take our own chances and pay our own dues
            C              D7        G
        The silver tounged devil and I


Like all the young ladies who've laid down beside him
She knew in her heart that he lied
But nothing that I could have said could have saved her
No matter how hard that I tried
'Cause she'll offer her soul up to darkness and danger
Of a world that she's never known
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger
Who'll love her and leave her alone

Repeat chorus
