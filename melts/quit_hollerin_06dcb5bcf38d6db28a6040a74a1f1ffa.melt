{ci:Intro:}
[F#m]
#
[F#m]I don't want your big French Fry
I don't want your car
I don't want to buy no soap
&gt;From no washed-up movie star
Y[Bm]ou are so much louder
Than the show I wanna hear
With your s[F#m]ugarless gum
Gee, but I'm dumb
Non-alcoholic beer
It's en[Bm]ough to make a grown man
Blow [E]up his own TV
Quit hollerin' at [F#m]me
Quit hollerin' at me

[F#m]I heard you the first time
I heard myself say
Seems like the little woman
Is getting bigger every day
Y[Bm]ou don't have to tell the neighbors
A little silence ain't no sin
They[F#m] already think my name is
Where in the hell you been?
Lo[Bm]uder, louder, louder, louder, lo[E]uder
Constantly
Quit hollerin' at [F#m]me
Quit hollerin' at me
W[Bm]hoa oh whoa [E]oh
S[Bm]weet Ser[F#m]enity
W[Bm]hoa oh whoa [E]oh
Q[Bm]uit hollerin' at [F#m]me
Quit hollerin' at me

[F#m]Ain't it great at the end of the day
When there ain't no sound around
Just me and the fence post
Staring each other down
[Bm]Nothing but a big bunch of nothing
Driving me insane
Cause there a[F#m]in't no voice that's louder
Than the one inside my brain
H[Bm]ey you go on
Go [E]on and let me be
Quit hollerin' at [F#m]me
Quit hollerin' at me
W[Bm]hoa oh whoa oh
Sw[Bm]eet Ser[F#m]enity
W[Bm]hoa oh whoa oh
Quit hollerin' at [F#m]me
Quit hollerin' at me
Quit hollerin' at me
Quit hollerin' at me
Quit hollerin' at me

[F#m] (Repeat and Fade....)
