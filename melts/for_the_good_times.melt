************ FOR THE GOOD TIMES *************

written and performed by Kris Kristofferson.


Verse 1:
                      G7                C
	Don't look so sad, I know it's over.
                      G7                                        C
	But life goes on, and this whole world will keep on turning.
                      F               G7                C
	Let just be glad we had some time to spend together.
	             F                 Dm                  G7
	There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning.


Chorus:
                  C             G7
	Lay your head upon my pillow.
                                                 C
	Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
                                                  F                 Dm
  	Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin soft against the window
      G7                                                             C
	And make believe you love me one more time, for the good times.


Verse 2:
                   G7                  C
	I'll get along, you'll find another
                     G7                                  C
	And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me.
                     F             G7           C
	Don't say a word about tommorrow or forever
                       F                 Dm                G7
	There will be time enough for sadness when you leave me.


Chorus.
