Verse 1:
	G                      B7
	Sittin' in the mornin' sun,
	        C7                C7(B7Bb7) A7
	I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes.
	G                       B7
	Watching the ships roll in,
	       C7           C7(B7Bb7) A7
	then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah.


Chorus:
	    G                          E
	I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,
	             G          E
	watching the tide roll away.
	             G                          A7
	Oo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay,
	G       E
	wastin' time.


Verse 2:
	G                      B7
	I left my home in Georgia,
	C7             C7(B7Bb7) A7
	headed for the 'Frisco Bay.
	G                      B7
	I have nothing to live for,
	C7                         C7(B7Bb7) A7
	it look like nothin's gonna come my way.


Bridge:
	G    D       C
	Look like nothing's gonna change.
	G  D   C
	Everything still remains the same.
	G D             C               
	I can't do what ten people tell me to do,
	F                 D7
	so I guess I'll remain the same, yes.


Verse 3:
	G                        B7
	I'm sittin' here restin' my bones,
	C7                        C7(B7Bb7) A7
	and this loneliness won't leave me alone, yes.
	G                       B7
	Two thousand miles I roamed
	C7                   C7(B7Bb7) A7
	just to make this-a dock my home..

	Whistling through end
