A Change Is Gonna Come chords
Sam Cooke

Capo III

G

      G                       Em
I was born by the river, in a little tent,
             Am                                Em
Oh, and just like that river, I've been running, ever since.

            G    Am           Em
It's been a long, a long time coming,
      C           B7
but I know, oh-oo-oh,
               Em        G           Em
a change gonna come, oh, yes it will

          G                         Em           Am
It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die,
                                Em
I don't know what's up there; beyond the sky.

            G    Am           Em
It's been a long, a long time coming,
      C           B7
but I know, oh-oo-oh,
               Em        G           Em
a change gonna come, oh, yes it will

  G                      Em          Am
I go to the movie, and I go downtown,
                          Em
somebody keep telling me; don't, hang around.

            G    Am           Em
It's been a long, a long time coming,
      C           B7
but I know, oh-oo-oh,
                  Em        G           Em Em Am
a change is gonna come, oh, yes it will

                Em       Am
Then I go to my brother,
                           Em  G    Am
and I say “brother help me please”.
                     Em           Em Em Am
And he just winds up; knocking me,
          A7    D7
back down on my knees

               G                                Em            Am
Oh, there been times when I thought, I couldn't last for long,
                             Em
but now I think, I'm able to carry on.

            G    Am           Em
It's been a long, a long time coming,
      C           B7
but I know, oh-oo-oh,
               Em        G           Em  G
a change gonna come, oh, yes it will
