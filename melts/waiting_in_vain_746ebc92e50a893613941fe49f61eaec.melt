G#maj7                      C#maj7
 From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, girl,
G#maj7                C#maj7
 My heart says follow through.
G#maj7                     C#maj7
 But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line,
G#maj7                   C#maj7
 But the waitin' feel is fine.

G#maj7                    C#maj7
 So don't treat me like a puppet on a string,
G#maj7                    C#maj7
 'Cos I know how to do my thing.
G#maj7               C#maj7
 Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb,
G#maj7                          C#maj7
 I wanna know when you're gonna come. See...

Verse 3:

G#maj7                           C#maj7
 It's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door,
G#maj7                      C#maj7
 And I still can knock some more.
G#maj7               C#maj7
 Ooh girl, ooh girl, is it feasible, (I wanna know now),
G#maj7               C#maj7
 For I to knock some more? Yah see...

G#maj7           C#maj7
 In life, I know, there's lots of grief,
G#maj7                  C#maj7
 But your love is my re-lief.
G#maj7                  C#maj7
 Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn,
          G#maj7                            C#maj7
While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn. See...
