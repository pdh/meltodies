Someone told me long ago
                                     G
There's a calm before the storm, I know
                               C 
And it's been coming for some time

When it's over, so they say
                            G
It'll rain a sunny day, I know
                     C  C
Shining down like water
F                G
REF.: I wanna know
          C    Em       Am
Have you ever seen the rain
F          G  
I wanna know
          C    Em       Am
Have you ever seen the rain
F        G                 C 
Coming down on a sunny day
C
2. Yesterday and days before
                                 G
Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
                    C
Been that way for all my time
C
'Til forever on it goes
                                  G
Thru the circle fast and slow, I know
                       C   C
And it can't stop, I wonder

Ref.: I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day
