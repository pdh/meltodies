Cross Tie Walker chords
Creedence Clearwater Revival

D

       G                                   D
I went down to the station, just to take a ride.
       G                                   D
I went down to the station, just to take a ride.
        A7                G            D
Found myself on a flatcar, yesterday behind.

        G                                         D
Pullin' out from the platform, there was no brass band.
         G                                      D
I pulled out from the platform, nobody raised a hand.
               A7                G                 D
And there were no tears of regret, from my runaway train.

Train, train, train, train.

G D A7 G D

       G                                        D
Got no sand in my pocket, you know I ain't tied down.
         G                               D
Ain't no sand in my pocket, never do sit down.
           A7               G                         D
I'm just a cross-tie walker, where the freight trains run.

Run, run, run, run.

G D A7 G D

       G                                  D
If you see me acomin', don't you waste my time.
       G                                  D
If you see me acomin', don't you waste my time.
               A7                   G                   D
'Cause there's more miles between us, than the Santa Fe Line.

Run, run, run, run.
