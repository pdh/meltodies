Intro: C        Csus4   (4X)   

C       Am          Em
Crimson flames tied through my ears
        F        G      C
Rollin' high and mighty trap
C         Am      Em      
Countless fire on flaming road
      F           G 
Using ideas as my maps
       Am             Em           
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I
F                   G
Proud 'neath heated brow.
        C             Am    Em
Ah, but I was so much older then,
    F       G         C 
I'm younger than that now.

C       Csus4   (2X)

C            Am        Em
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
     F        G        C
"Rip down all hate," I screamed
C         Am      Em
Lies that life is black and white
      F                G
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
   Am              Em
Romantic flanks of Musketeers
     F                 G
Foundationed deep, somehow.
        C             Am    Em
Ah, but I was so much older then,
    F       G         C 
I'm younger than that now.

C       Csus4   (2X)    

      C        Am        Em
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
       F       G        C
At the mongrel dogs who teach
        C         Am      Em     
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
       F              G
In the instant that I preach
Am                  Em        
Existence led by confusion boats
F                    G
Mutiny from stern to bow.
        C             Am    Em
Ah, but I was so much older then,
    F       G         C 
I'm younger than that now.

C   Am  Em

Am  Em
F   G

        C             Am    Em
Ah, but I was so much older then,
    F       G         C 
I'm younger than that now.

C       Csus4   (2X)    

   C           Am        Em
My guard stood hard when abstract threats
    F     G     C
Too noble to neglect
    C       Am    Em
Deceived me into thinking
      F               G
I had something to protect
Am              Em
Good and bad, I define these terms
      F                    G        
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
        C             Am    Em
Ah, but I was so much older then,
    F       G         C                 
I'm younger than that now.
