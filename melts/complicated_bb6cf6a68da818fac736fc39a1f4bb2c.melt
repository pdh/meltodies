B7
Ah, har har har har 
     Cm#
She looks so simple in her way 

Does the same thing everyday 
 G#
But she's dedicated 
                   A
To having her own way 
                  E
She's very complicated 
B7
Ah, har, har, har, har 

Yeah 

Cm#
Women seem to fill her mind 

And many men in so short time 
 G#
But she's underrated 
                     A
She treats me oh so kind 
                  E
She's very complicated 
B7
Ha, har har har, har 

Yeah 

Cm#
We talk together and discuss 

What is really best for us 
 G#
She's sophisticated 
                  A
My head's fit to bust 
                      E
Cause she's so complicated 
B7
Ah, ha har har, har 

Cm#
She knows just how to please her man 

Softer than a baby lamb 
 G#
But she's educated 
                A
Doesn't give a damn 
                  E
She's very complicated 
B7
Har, har har har, har 

Na, na na na num 

Dm
She looks so simple in her way 

Does the same thing everyday 
 A
But she's dedicated 
                   A#
To having her own way 
                  F
She's very complicated 
C7
Har, har har har, har....
