Subject: "Love --&gt; Building on Fire"  by Talking Heads 

opening guitar/bass i just notes on the d string (or e).

     D       G                 D          G
when my love    stands next to your love,

           D          G           D         G
I can't compare love    when it's not love.

     D         G       D          G
It's not love;    It's not love

         D        G             D         G
Which is my face,    which is a building,

(the chords start here)

            D      G
which is on fire
 
   D     G
on fire.


so the whole song is just D for one measure and G for the next.  It 
changes at the instrumental with the horns before "I got two loves"

         |: F     C     C     G :|
Which is on fire 

then it instantly goes back to D and G until the final chord which is a 
D.  it sounds cool if, after the instrumental you strum the D chord with 
long strums while you strum the G chord withfour staccato quarter note 
hits.

have fun.
