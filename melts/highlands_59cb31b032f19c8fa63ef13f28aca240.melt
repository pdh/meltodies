E7
Well my heart's in The Highlands, gentle and fair

Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air
A                                           E7
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow
        B7         
Well my heart's in The Highlands
          A                                   E7
I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go
