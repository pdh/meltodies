No More Auction Block

Trad. (arr. Bob Dylan)
Recorded live at the Gaslight cafe, late 1962. Released on The Bootleg Series 1-3 (1991)

Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

This is reportedly the melody that Dylan used for Blowin' in the Wind. This is 
most evident in the beginning of the verses and in the guitar interlude.

Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)
Played with fast strumming in a rather loose rhythm.
