Bob Dylan
Make You Feel My Love (1997)
(Dylan)

This tab is my reading of the studio version from "Time Out of Mind".
There are live versions without the capo, too, which feature 
variations of the chords used on the studio recording.

There are some chords here that could be interpreted differently, but I 
think it is at least close. Any suggestions are highly welcome!
