intro:  C   D/C  F   F  F/G  2x

C           Dm  Em  Am                       F/D
  To be invisible         Will be my claim to fame
               F/G                                     C
A man with no name That way I won't have to feel the pain
C            Dm  Em  Am                     F/D
Indispensable       Just a plain old human being
                    F/G                        G
Today don't mean a thing In a world that's so mean
Am                       Dm     C                  Dm  Em  Am
world that seems not for me So privately I'll be invisible
                           F/D
That way I won't have to explain a thing If you know what I mean
F/G                                     C
I won't even have to be here on the scene
               Dm  Em  Am
It's so ridiculous     But the strife and the bliss
        F/D              F/G                    G
Will go right on through Right on through me To have missed
Am                             Dm
All the things that hurt your soul
              C         C                    
No one would ever know They'd never know   
Am                           D/C             F                      F/G
Life so preciously Just don't seem to be   As free as they claim freedom to be 
C                          D                                 
Things are going fast  To have found that all is in the past
 F                                 F/G
To have to take what you can get Sure can make a heart upset
C           Dm  Em  Am                       F/D
Indispensable I must behave myself
         F/G                                     C
For somebody else Who may have a little fame, fortune or wealth

It's so ridiculous But the strife and the bliss
Will go right on through Right on through me To have missed

A world that seems not for me So privately I'll be invisible
That way I won't have to explain a thing
If you know what I mean I won't even have to be here on the scene

It's so ridiculous But the strife and the bliss
Will go right on through Right on through me To have missed

All the things that hurt your soul No one would ever know They'd never know
 Life so preciously Just don't seem to be As free as they claim freedom to be
 Things are going fast To have found that all is in the past
To have to take what you can get Sure can make a heart upset

So I'll be invisible Invisible Invisible
