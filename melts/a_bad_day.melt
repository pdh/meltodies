Verse 1: 
         D 
      I guess it all started when i woke up this morning 
                    G     D A 
      Everything seemed okay 
 
      'Til i let my pet snake get loose in the kitchen 
                                      D 
      Now i've been in trouble all day 
 
Verse 2: 
         D           
      I got some paint on the wall,a pretty orange color 
                              G     D    A 
      And a little on the carpet and floor 
       
      I covered it up with Mom's coat from the closet 
                                         D 
      That she says she can't wear anymore 

Refr√£o -------------
         D  
      I've had a bad,bad day 
                                   A 
      Not like i thought it would be 
 
      I've had a bad,bad day 
                                             D 
      It seems like everyone's pickin' on me
--------------------
Verse 3: 
         D  
      I put some sand in my Grandpa's tobacco 
                           G D    A  
      And he frowned at me all day 
 
      Then i hid his pipe 'cause it smells when he smokes it 
                               D 
      He shouldn't smoke anyway 
 
Verse 4: 
         D   
      So between Mom's coat and my Granpa's tobacco 
                      G   D     A  
      Life can be rough on a kid 
 
      They've almost worn out the seat of my britches 
                                       D  
      It don't hurt much now,but it did 
 
Chorus (x2).
