#1.
  G      C             F7                   C
I go out walking after midnight, out in the moonlight,
G7   C       F       C
just like we used to do.
    F7     C              F7        G7            C   F C G
I'm always walking, after midnight, searching for you.

#2.
G          C                F7                            C
I walk for miles, along the highway, well, that's just my way,
G7 C      F      C
of saying I love you.
    G7     C              F7        G7            C   F C C7
I'm always walking, after midnight, searching for you.

CHORUS:
  C7      F                     Fdim
I stop to see a weeping willow, crying on his pillow..
C          F          C C7
maybe he's crying for me.
    F                         Fdim
And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me..
    C           Dm7   G
I'm lonesome as I can be.

#3.
G        C             F7                   C
I go out walking after midnight, out in the moonlight,
G7   C          F   C                            F7
just hoping you may be..somewhere walking, after midnight,
G7            C F C C7
searching for me.

CHORUS:
  C7      F                     Fdim
I stop to see a weeping willow, crying on his pillow..
C          F          C C7
maybe he's crying for me.
    F                         Fdim
And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me..
    C           Dm7   G
I'm lonesome as I can be.

OUTRO:

I go out walking after midnight, out in the moonlight,
