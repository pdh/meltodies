       G           D           B7      C
Well I once knew a man who was going insane
       G              E          A     D
He let love chase him right up a tree
            G            D
It took the police and a fire truck
        B7             C
Just to bring him back down
      G                 D          G
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me


            G                 D
It made the front page of the paper
    B7             C
The gossip tongues wagged
         G              E      A   D
Why they even showed it all on TV
       G                 D
Now if he should live forever
   B7            C
He won't live it down
      G                 D          G
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me


D
Dogs bites Man
G
Man loses girl
   A
Oh what did he ever do
D
Wrong in this world?

      G          D        B7       C
There once was a big buzz all over town
        G               E           A    D
About a movie where the killer goes free
          G      D        B7    C
Now, he's got every one's sympathy
      G                 D          G
Oh, I hate it when that happens to me
       G                 D          G
Yes, I hate it when that happens to me
