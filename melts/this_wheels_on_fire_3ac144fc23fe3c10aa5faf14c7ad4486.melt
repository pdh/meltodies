This song is from Dylan's 1975 album 'The Basement Tapes'. It's a pretty good song. I 
you should listen to it.

  Am
If your me mory serves you well
A
We were goin' to meet again and wait
  E
So I'm go in to unpack all my things
  F Dm Am
And  sit before it  gets to o late
  C Am
No  man alive will c ome to you
  C Am
With a nother tale to t ell
  C Am
But you kn ow that we shall m eet again
  F Dm Am
If your me mory se rves you w ell

CHORUS:
  Dm F C G G7
  This wheel's on f ire, rol ling down the r oad
  C G F C
Best n otif y my ne xt of k in
  F G A
T his wheel s hall exp lode!

Am
If your memory serves you well
B07
I was goin' to confiscate your lace
             E
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot
F           Dm       Am
And hide it in your case

     C                          Am
If I knew for sure that it was yours
      C                  Am
But it was oh so hard to tell
              C                  Am
But you knew that we would meet again
    F          Dm         Am
If your memory serves you well ...CHORUS

         Am
If your memory serves you well
 A
You'll remember you're the one
    E
That called on me to call on them
   F       Dm           Am
To get you your favors done

     C                    Am
And after every plan had failed
     C                        Am
And there was nothing more to tell
      C                   Am
You knew that we would meet again
     F          Dm        Am
If your memory served you well ...CHORUS


Enjoy!
