 Sedan Delivery : Rust Never Sleeps : Neil Young

 barre chords go from A to G very quickly throughout

 Av   Giii        A           G         A
 Last night I was cool at the pool hall 

          G          A     G     A
 Held the table for eleven games 

             G      A              G     A
 Nothing was easier than the first seven 

          G          A        G    
 I beat a woman with varicose veins

 D                                 DM7   
 She stopped to see herself in the mirror

                           D7   
 Fix her hair and hide her veins

                  A    G     
 But she lost the game  .....

                               
 Next day I went to the dentist
 He pulled some teeth and I lost some blood
 We'd like to thank you for the cards you sent us
 My wives and I were all choked up
 
 D                  (ie - no changes to DM7 and D7)
                             
 I recall how Ceaser and Cleo
 Made love in the Milky Way
 They needed boats and armies to get there
 I know there's a better way
 I saw the movie and I read the book
 But when it happened to me
 I sure was glad that I had what it took
 To get away

 Gotta get away
 Gotta get away
 Gotta get away
 Gotta get away
                            
 I'm makin' another delivery
 Of chemicals and sacred roots
 I'll hold what you have to give me
 But I'll use what I have to use
 The lasers are in the lab
 The old man is dressed in white clothes
 Everybody says he's mad
 Nobody knows the things he knows
             
 No one knows
 No one knows
 No one knows
 No one knows
                             
 I'm lookin' in every hallway
 I still can't accept the stares/stairs
 I'm sleepin with many covers
 I'm warm now so I don't care
 I'm thinkin' of noone in my mind
 Sedan delivery is a job I know I'll keep
 It sure was hard to find
             
 Hard to find
 Hard to find
 Hard to find
 (Hard to find a job)
 Hard to find

 sometimes, there seems to be a further note dropped  right before going back 
 to the A's and G's... but this is difficult to play.
