Leonard Cohen: I'm your man.

This song is from the CD "I'm your man" and can also be heard in an

italian film called "Caro diario" by the film-maker Nanni Moretti (1994).

This film won the price for the best direction in Cannes 1994.

I am interested in the words and chords of the song "Passing Through" and

in chords of the songs appeared on the albums "Various Positions" and

"Death of a Laidies Man" (e.g. Hallelujah, If it be your will, True love

leave no traces, ...). I would be thankful if you can help me.
