Am                     E
You walk into the room With your pencil in your hand
F                                   Am
You see somebody naked And you say, "Who is that man?"
F               Dm
You try so hard But you don't understand
C                Em  Am
Just what you'll say When you get home 
C                    Em
Because something is happening here 
Am
But you don't know what it is 
F              Am
Do you, Mister Jones 


Am                                     E

You raise up your head And you ask, "Is this where it is?" 

F                                   Am
And somebody points to you and says "It's his" 

F               Dm
And you say, "What's mine?" 

C                Em  Am
And somebody else says, "Where what is?" 

C                    Em
And you say, "Oh my God Am I here all alone?" 

Because something is happening here 

But you don't know what it is 

Do you, Mister Jones


Am                                  E
 You hand in your ticket And you go watch the geek 

F                                   Am
Who immediately walks up to you When he hears you speak 

F                                Dm
And says, "How does it feel To be such a freak?" 

C                Em  Am
And you say, "Impossible" As he hands you a bone 

C                    Em
Because something is happening here
Am
But you don't know what it is 

F              Am
Do you, Mister Jones 





Am                     E
You have many contacts Among the lumberjacks 
F                                                    Am
To get you facts When somebody attacks your imagination 
Am                         E
But nobody has any respect Anyway they already expect you 
F                       Dm                           G
To just give a check To tax-deductible charity organizations 
G7
AHHHHH!



Am                     E

You've been with the professors And they've all liked your looks 

F                                   Am
With great lawyers you have Discussed lepers and crooks 

F                                 Dm
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books 

C                Em  Am
You're very well read It's well known 

C                    Em
Because something is happening here 
Am
But you don't know what it is 

F              Am
Do you, Mister Jones 



Am                                           E
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you And then he kneels 

F                                   Am
He crosses himself And then he clicks his high heels 

F                                         Dm
And without further notice He asks you how it feels 

C                Em  Am
And he says, "Here is your throat back Thanks for the loan" 

C                    Em
Because something is happening here 
Am
But you don't know what it is 

F              Am
Do you, Mister Jones 










Am                                   E
Now you see this one-eyed midget Shouting the word "NOW" 

F                                   Am
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?" 

F                                                  Dm
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow! 

C                Em  Am
Give me some milk Or else go home" 

C                    Em
Because something is happening here 
Am
But you don't know what it is 

F              Am
Do you, Mister Jones 


    






Am                                       E
Well, you walk into the roomLike a camel and then you frown 

F                                   Am
You put your eyes in your pocket And your nose on the ground 

F                                     Dm
There ought to be a law Against you comin' around 

C                Em  Am
You should be made To wear earphones 

C                    Em
Because something is happening here
Am
But you don't know what it is 

F              Am
Do you, Mister Jones
