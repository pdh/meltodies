If You See Her, Say Hello; Bob Dylan

If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
G                   C     G                          F  D
 She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear
Em               C       G                               C
 Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
          Em                 G/D               C                G
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.
G               C      G       D          G   
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
G                   C                     G                  F  D
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
Em               C           G                   C
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
Em               G/D               C                G
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
G               C      G       D          G   
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
G                   C                     G                  F  D
I always have respected her for doin' what she did and gettin' free
Em               C           G                   C
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way.
Em                 G/D               C                G
Oh, the bitter taste still lingers on,from that night I tried to make her stay.
G               C      G       D          G   
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
G                   C                  G               F  D
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Em               C           G                   C
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Em                 G/D         C                G
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.
G               C      G       D          G   
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
G             C             G               F  D
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
Em               C           G                   C
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Em                 G/D           C             G
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
