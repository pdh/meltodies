I've dragged so much stuff off Nevada, I figured it's time to post something. 
This is the version from "VU Live 1969" and includes the "Why am I So Shy?"
interlude.

                                  Lisa Says
                                                By Lou Reed

  F                  C              Bb
    Lisa says on a night like this,  
                             C     F
    be so nice if you'd give me a kiss.
  F                              C           Bb
    And Lisa says for just one little smile, 
                                 C      F
    I'll sit next to you for a little while.

CHORUS:
  F       C   Bb       F           C   Bb       F
    Lisa says,   Lisa says,  Lisa says,   Lisa says

  F                             C             Bb
    Lisa says you must be some kind of fool,
                                C    F
    The way you treat everybody so cruel.
                               C                   Bb
    And Lisa says you must be a funny kind of guy,
                                  C       F
    The way you're always staring at the sky.
