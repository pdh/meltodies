        E                     A                E    
There's coming a day when the world shall melt away
                                  B7   
And Jesus shall come to claim his own
        E                            A              E   
No more tears no pain no woe in this wicked world below
                 B7          E    
Then will you be ready to go home
 

A                       E                   
Will you be ready to go ready to go home
                                     B7      
To live with Him up there around the throne
        E                           A                 E    
When He says come unto Me will your soul be clean and free
                 B7          E    
Then will you be ready to go home
 

        E                                A                  E    
In this world of greed and hate will you wait till it's too late
                             B7   
To claim the Savior for your own
         E                 A               E   
For He's coming someday to bear your soul away
                 B7          E    
Then will you be ready to go home
 

       E                 A                    E   
As you travel day by day down life's long highway
                                  B7     
Are you on the road that leads to wrong
               E                       A                 E     
If you'll just travel in His light and pray both day and night
               B7          E    
Then you'll be ready to go home
