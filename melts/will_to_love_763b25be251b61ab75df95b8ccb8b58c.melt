(verse)
It has often been my dream
To live with one
    who wasn't there
Like an ocean fish
    who swam upstream
Through nets,
    by hooks, and hungry bears.

When the water grew less deep
My fins were aching
    from the strain
I'm swimming in my sleep
I know I can't go back again.

(chorus)
Got the will to love,
    the will to love.
I'll never lose it,
    never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like
    something from up above.

I can be like
    a fire in the night
Always warm
    and giving off light
But there comes a time
    when I shine too bright
Oh, I'm just a fire in the night.

And now my fins are in the air
And my belly's
    scraping on the rocks
I still think
    someone really cares
And I'll keep swimming
    till I stop.

Got the will to love,
    the will to love.
I'll never lose it,
    never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like
    something from up above.

I'm like a singer on the stage
With the golden lights
    and liquid rage
Down from the mountains
    to the sea
Cool running love
    keeps cleansing me.

It keeps my gills
    from getting dry
But it distorts things
    in my eyes
Sometimes I see
    what really isn't there
Like my true lover, and I care.

Got the will to love,
    the will to love.
I'll never lose it,
    never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like
    something from up above.

Sometimes I ramble on and on
And I repeat myself
    till all my friends are gone
And get lost in snow
    and drown in rain
And never feel the same again.

I remember the ocean
    from where I came
Just one of millions all the same
But somewhere
    someone calls my name
I'm a harpoon dodger,
    and I can't, won't be tamed.

Got the will to love,
    the will to love.
I'll never lose it,
    never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like
    something from up above.

Baby, if I see boredom
    in your eyes
I'll know my river has run dry
But I won't turn back
    with that lonely tide
I bought that ticket
    and I'll take that ride.

If we meet along the way
Please sway beside me,
    let us sway together
Our tails together
    and our fins and mind
We'll leave this water
    and let our scales shine
In the sun above
    and the sky below
So all the water
    and earth will know

It has often been my dream
To live with one
    who wasn't there.
