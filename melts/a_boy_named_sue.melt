E
My daddy left home when I was three
A
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
B                                                                                             E
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
E
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
A
But the meanest thing that he ever did
B                                                                                           E
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue."

Repeat that the whole song.
