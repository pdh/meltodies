Johnny Cash (Webster/Bennett The Sweet By and By) from Personal File album 2006

Capo II

A

          A            D           A
There's a land that is fairer than day, 
                            E  E7
And by faith we can see it afar; 
        A            D        A
For the Father waits over the way 
                E7             A
To prepare us a dwelling place there. 

       A            E
In the sweet by and by, 
         E7           E         A
We shall meet on that beautiful shore; 
       A7           D
In the sweet by and by, 
         A            E7        A
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 

         A            D         A
We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
                           E      E7
The melodious songs of the blessed; 
        A             D         A
And our spirits shall sorrow no more, 
                   E7          A
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest. 

       A            E
In the sweet by and by, 
         E7           E         A
We shall meet on that beautiful shore; 
       A7           D
In the sweet by and by, 
         A            E7        A
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 

       A         D       A
To our bountiful Father above, 
                             E     E7
We will offer our tribute of praise 
        A        D           A
For the glorious gift of His love 
                       E7         A
And the blessings that hallow our days. 

       A            E
In the sweet by and by, 
         E7           E         A
We shall meet on that beautiful shore; 
       A7           D
In the sweet by and by, 
         A            E7        A
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
