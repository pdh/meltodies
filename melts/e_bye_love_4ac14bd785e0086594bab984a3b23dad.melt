Song title: Bye Bye Love 
Performed by: Simon and Garfunkel
Album: Bridge Over Troubled Water
Chords interpreted by: Hans Julian Sloman



Sound available on YouTube /watch?v=d0gLnfSgdLA

The song seems to be using only the chords B, F# and C# (and E5 in the intro); 
however there are multiple ways of creating those sounds. 
Another version available on here tells you to play 
A, E, and B, (and D5) while using a capo in 2nd fret. 
However getting from E to B can be awkward for beginners, 
so here's a version that I came up with that might make it 
easier for you, while still being able to play along with the song 
(e.g. not in a different key):


Capo 7th fret

INTRO:  C  A5  F   F  A5  C

[CHORUS]
F        C
Bye bye, love.

F        C
Bye bye, happiness.

F      C
Hello, loneliness.

C           G       C
I think I'm gonna cry.

F        C
Bye bye, love.

F        C
Bye bye, sweet caress.

F      C
Hello, emptiness.

C           G         C
I feel like I could die.

C           G           C
Bye bye, my love, goodbye.

[VERSE 1]

C             G
There goes my baby

G            C
With someone new.

C              G
She sure looks happy;

G         C
I sure am blue.

C          F
She was my baby

F                G
'till he stepped in.

G
Goodbye, to romance

G               C
That might have been.

(CHORUS)

[VERSE 2]

C                G
I'm through with romance.

G                C
I'm through with love.

C                G
I'm through with counting

G          C
The stars above,

C              F
And here's the reason

F           G
That I'm so free:

G
My lovin' baby

G               C
Is through with me.

(CHORUS)

(repeat and fade)  Goodbye, my love goodbye.Â­






(some more notes: 
-7th fret is quite far up for a capo, so it only works on good acoustics or
electric guitars
-play A5 simply like a normal A except you only hit the A, D and G string/or 
you can mute the B string.
-If you don't care for playing/singing along with the record, there are lots 
of easy variations available (e.g. Transposing, with change of key). 
For example you could play C, G, and D; or D, A, and E; or you can play the
 version described here without a capo.
