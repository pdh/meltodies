This Love Is Real.........John Prine

D                A               D
I can taste your lipstick in the wine,
  G             A                  D
I can feel your heartbeat close to mine.
 G                     A              D  C       G      C G C G
With your love wrapped around me, I'm silent and still.
G           A            D
I know that this love is real.
  D                 A                   D
I have tasted other lips I thought were true,
  G                     A                  D
I have looked into the eyes I thought were you.
     G        A                 D       C       G     C G C G
Now touching just to touch, and feeling just to feel,
G           A            D
I know that this love is real.  (Instr: D A D G A D G A D G C G C G)
Bm                                          A
Someone should tell our dreams when love is gone,
Bm                                      A
While still in slumber, memories linger on
Bm                                A                  G              A
Sometimes I lie awake in bed till dawn, thinking of you, now you're gone
D             A                    D     G             A            D
Tender is the heart that sleeps in rest, tender is the hope of tenderness
G                 A               D    C          G   C G C G
Love thy neighbor as thyself and thou shall not steal
G           A            D
I know that this love is real
G                 A               D    C          G   C G C G
Love thy neighbor as thyself and thou shall not steal
G           A            D
I know that this love is real
