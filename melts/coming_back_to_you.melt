                      Coming Back To You    (Leonard Cohen)

     F  /  Dm  /  Bb  C/G  F  /  /  /

      F               Dm        Bb       C/G            F
     Maybe I'm still hurting I can't turn   the other cheek

                                Dm           C/G       Bb        F
     But you know that I still love you it's just that I can't speak

        Bb               F                  A                Bb
     I looked for you in everyone and they called me on that too

        F      C       Dm    Am   Bb      C       F
     I lived alone but I was only coming back to you

                                Dm                   Bb       C/G       F
     They're shutting down the factory now just when all the bills are due

                                   Dm
     And the fields they're under lock and key

                C/G          Bb          F
     Though the rain and the sun come through

           Bb                    F                   A                Bb
     And springtime starts but then it stops in the name of something new

          F       C      Dm     Am        Bb      C       F
     And all the senses rise against this coming back to you

                  Bb              F                  Bb               F
     And they're handing down my sentence now and I know what I must do

       A             Bb                 G              C
     Another mile of silence while I'm coming back to you

       F            Dm                Bb   C/G      F
     There are many in your life and many still to be

                      Dm                   C/G   Bb          F
     Since you are a shining light there's many that you'll see

            Bb               F               A                 Bb
     But I have to deal with envy when you choose the precious few

             F           C          Dm     Am     Bb      C       F
     Who've left their pride on the other side of coming back to you

     Bb  /  F  /  Bb  /  F  /  A  /  Bb  /  G  /  C  /  /  /

     F             Dm     Bb       C/G           F
     Even in your arms I know I'll never get it right

                    Dm             C/G     Bb      F
     Even when you bend to give me comfort in the night

          Bb                F               A             Bb
     I've got to have your word on this or none of it is true

          F        C        Dm      Am     Bb      C       F
     And all I've said was just instead of coming back to you
