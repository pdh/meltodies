************* AMERICA ************

written by Sammy Johns and performed by Waylon Jennings.


Verse 1:
                   D
	Some have said,done through history

	If you last it's a mistery
               A                                          D
	But i guess they don't know,what they're talking about
                   D
	From the mountains down to the sea

	You've become such a habit with me
           A              D
	America,A-merher-ica


Verse 2:
                    D
	Well i come from,down around Tennesee

	But the people in California
              A                  D
	Are nice to me,A-merher-ica
                   D
	It don't matter where i may roam

	Tell you people that it's home sweet home
           A              D
	America,A-merher-ica


Chorus:
                  G                                  Bm
	And my brothers are all black and white,yellow too
                                      A                 G
	And the red man is right,to expect a little from you
           A                       G         D
	Promise and then follow through,America


Verse 3:
                 D
	And the men,who fell on the planes

	And lived,through hardship and pain
           A              D
	America,A-merher-ica
                 D
	And the men who could not fight

	In a war that didn't seem right
                A                        D
	You let them come home,A-merher-ica


Chorus.


Verse 4:
                     D
	Well i come from,down around Tennesee

	But the people in California
              A                  D
	Are nice to me,A-merher-ica
                   D
	It don't matter where i may roam

	Tell you people that it's home sweet home
           A              D
	America,A-merher-ica
           A              D
	America,A-merher-ica

             A                        D
	It's home sweet home,A-merher-ica
           A              D
	America,A-merher-ica
