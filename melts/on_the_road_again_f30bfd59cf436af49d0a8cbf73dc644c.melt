this is how I play the song. I think itÂ´s accurate...

tabs at the end.

Intro: A

A
Well, I woke up in the morning

There's frogs inside my socks

Your mama, she's a-hidin'

Inside the icebox
D
Your daddy walks in wearin'
                          A
A Napoleon Bonaparte mask          .
            E                      D
Then you ask why I don't live here
                           A
Honey, do you have to ask?


Well, I go to pet your monkey
I get a face full of claws
I ask who's in the fireplace
And you tell me Santa Claus
The milkman comes in
He's wearing a derby hat
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?

Well, I asked for something to eat
I'm hungry as a hog
So I get brown rice, seaweed
And a dirty hot dog
I've got a hole
Where my stomach disappeared
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I gotta think you're really weird.

Your grandpa's cane
It turns into a sword
Your grandma prays to pictures
That are pasted on a board
Everything inside my pockets
Your uncle steals
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real.

SOLO: A

Well, there's fist fights in the kitchen
They're enough to make me cry
The mailman comes in
Even he's gotta take a side
Even the butler
He's got something to prove
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you don't move?
