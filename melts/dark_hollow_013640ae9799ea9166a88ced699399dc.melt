Dark Hollow

This song can be played with a capo at the second fret, thus the 
chord's are listed as you play them with the capo, and the true
chord is listed in parenthisis.

Intro: (This part isn't played with a capo, because of the low E,
        so another guitar is needed if you want to play this part..
        It can be used after each line that ends in the G (A) chord too.

 (A)(true chord...)
