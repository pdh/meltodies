Verse #1

A                            A7              D
You say you love me then you treat me like a stranger
A                               E7
I don't understand your kind of love
        A               A7                 D
You say you need me and that makes it even stranger
   A            E7                 A
No I don't understand your kind of love


Verse #2

   E7                         A
If you can't be all mine then why am I all yours
  B7                             E7
I wonder where a heart draws the line
      A                  A7             D
I try not to see you but you're a great arranger
   A            E7                 A
No I don't understand your kind of love


(Instrumental plays here, along with backup singers humming,
basically play/hum the last line of verse 2 above)


Verse#3

   E7                         A
If you can't be all mine then why am I all yours
  B7                             E7
I wonder where a heart draws the line
      A                  A7             D
I try not to see you but you're a great arranger
   A            E7                 A
No I don't understand your kind of love

                E7                 A
No I don't understand your kind of love
