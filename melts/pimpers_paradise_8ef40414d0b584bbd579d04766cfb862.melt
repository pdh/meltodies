...PIMPER'S PARADISE... by Bob Marley
-----------------------..............

*from 'Uprising' (1980)*


Intro:

C, G

Verse 1:

Fmaj7               G
 She love to party, have a good time,
Fmaj7                 G
 She looks so hearty, feeling fine.
Fmaj7                         G
 She loves to smoke, sometime shifting coke,
Fmaj7                          Em
 She'll be laughing when there ain't no joke.

Chorus 1:

  Fmaj7                     G
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was now,
  Fmaj7                     Em
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was.
  Fmaj7                     G
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was now,
  Fmaj7                     Em
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was.

Bridge 1:

      C            G           Am  F
Every need, got an ego to feed,
      C            G           Am  F
Every need, got an ego to feed.

Verse 2:

Fmaj7                          G
 She loves to model up, in the latest fashion,
Fmaj7                          G
 She's in the scramble and she moves with passion.
Fmaj7                          G
 She's getting high; trying to fly the sky,
Fmaj7                           Em
 Now she is bluesing when there ain't no blues.

Chorus 2:

  Fmaj7                     G
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was now,
  Fmaj7                     Em
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was.
  Fmaj7                     G
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was now,
  Fmaj7                     Em
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was.

Bridge 2:

      C            G           Am  F
Every need, got an ego to feed,
      C            G           Am  F
Every need, got an ego to feed.

Chorus 3:

  Fmaj7                     G
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was now,
  Fmaj7                     Em
A pimper's paradise; that's all she was.
  Fmaj7                                G
A pimper's paradise; I'm sorry for the victim now,
Fmaj7
 Soon their heads, soon their heads,
Em
 Soon their, soon their very heads will bow.
Fmaj7
 Pimper's paradise; don't lose track,
      G
Don't lose track of yourself, oh no!
Fmaj7
 Pimper's paradise; don't be just a-stuck,
Em
 A-stuck on the shelf, stuck on the shelf,
Fmaj7                      G
 Pimper's paradise; that's all she was now.
  Fmaj7                 Em
A pimper's paradise; be careful, be careful...
