Mr. Rebound 
 
Bb
My sweetheart she bounced right out of my arms
        C 
She was gone before I remembered to cling
Bb
Did I reach out too slowly to catch her
   C                    G
Or was she by nature a slippery thing

Chorus:
Dm       Am      Dm  Am       Dm       Am      C        Am
Into the arms of Mr  Rebound, into the arms of clean up Joe
Dm       Am      Dm  Am       F  Am                      Dm
Into the arms of Mr  Rebound, Mr Rebound, as if I didn't know

He'll give her laughs and he'll give her dreams
I gave her the kids and the pots and pans
He'll do for the dash and he'll do for the sprint
But he won't do for a marathon man

Chorus

I know for a fact that she ain't coming back
To tell you the truth, I'm a little bit glad
She may be blind with the things on her mind
But how can she stand to touch something that bad

Chorus
