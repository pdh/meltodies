Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
B                C#m            A            E
Please forget you know my name, my darling sugaree
B                  E        C#m                           A
Shake it, shake it sugaree, just don't tell them that you know me
B                  E        C#m                           A
Shake it, shake it sugaree, just don't tell them that you know me

You thought you was the cool fool
and never could do no wrong
Had everything sewed up tight. 
how come you lay awake all night long

(Repeat Chorus)

Well in spite of all you had gained
you still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you 
and I guess it's time you go

(Repeat Chorus)

Well shake it up now sugaree, 
I'll meet you at the jubilee
and if that jubilee dont come
well i'll meet you on the run

(Repeat Chorus)
B                  E        C#m                           A
Shake it, shake it sugaree, just don't tell them that you know me
B                  E        C#m                           A     E    B
Shake it, shake it sugaree, just don't tell them that you know       me
