CHORUS
C             G
Get down boys go back home
D                    G
Back to the girl you love

Treat her right never wrong
D                       G
How mountain girls can love


VERSE 1
G
Riding the night in the high cold wind
        D                         G
On the trail of that old lonesome pine
G
Thinkin' of you feeling so blue
D                        G
Wonderin' why I left you behind


(CHORUS)


VERSE 2
Remember the night we strolled down the lane
Our hearts were gay and happy then
You whispered to me when I held you close
We hoped that night would never end


(CHORUS)
