       E                A
Now Claudine's back in jail again
  E                 A
Claudine's back in jail again
  E                 A               B     
Claudine's back in jail again, Claudine 

  E                 A
Claudine's back in jail again
  E                 A
Claudine's back in jail again

She only does it at weekends
      B    A
Claudine

          3 chords  E  A  and B ***

Now only Spider knows for sure
But he ain't talkin' about it any more
Is he, Claudine? 

There was blood in the chalet
And blood in the snow
She washed her hands of the whole damn show, Claudine

Shot him once right through the head
Shot him twice right through the chest
The judge says ruled it was an accident, Claudine
Accidents will happen

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine 

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine                     Yeah

Poor Claudine
Poor Claudine

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again, Claudine

Poor Claudine
Poor Claudine
Poor poor Claudine

Now I threaten my wife with a gun
I always leave the safety on
I recommend it, Claudine 

Yes she pistol whipped me once or twice
But she never tried to take my life
What do you think about that, Claudine 

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
She only does it at weekends, Claudine

Oooo ...poor Claudine 
What about the children, baby?
Poor, poor children

You're the prettiest girl I ever seen
I saw you on the movie screen
Hope you don't try to make a sacrifice of me, Claudine
Don't get trigger happy with me, Claudine 
Don't wave a gun at me. Claudine 

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again, Claudine 

Oh Claudine
