Verse 1: 
         E 
      You get a pen and i'll get a paper 
                                       B 
      We're gonna write ourselves a song 
 
      We'll drive the poetics crazy 
                                               E 
      I don't think the damn thing's gonna rhyme 
 
Verse 2: 
         E  
      I got a friend and i think he's goofy 
                                        B 
      I guess he thinks the same about me 
    
      Guess it really takes one to know one 
                                            E 
      And you look like an old friend of mine (kind of short red headed) 
 
Verse 3: 
         E 
      Out all night and acting crazy 
                                  B   
      I've been up for two whole days 
 
      Turn me over and roll me over 
                                  E  
      Wind me up for one more rhyme 
 
Verse 4: 
         E 
      Well he called me friend and he called me brother 
                                      B 
      I called him back but he was gone (i didn't call him nothing) 
 
      He took my songs and he took my money 
                                                   E      
      But the jokes on him he's the friend of a fool,of a fool,of a fool 
 
Verse 5: 
         E 
      You get a pen and i'll get a paper 
                                       B 
      We're gonna steal ourselves a song 
 
      We'll drive the poetics crazy 
                                    E  
      The damn thing just might rhyme
