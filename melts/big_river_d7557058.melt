                           Big River
                         by Johnny Cash

F       
     Now, I taught the weepin willow how to cry, and I showed the clouds how
                     G         C             F
     to cover up a clear blue sky, but the tears that I cried for that woman
                               Bb                             C  
     are gonna flood you, big river, and I'm gonna sit right here until I 
      F
     die.  I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota, and it tore me up
                              G               C              F
     every time I heard her drawl, southern drawl.  Then I heard my dream 
                                             Bb            
     went back downstream, cavortin in Davenport, and I followed you, big
       C               F
     river, when you called.


     Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river.  A freighter said
     said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone.  I found her 
     trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff, she raised a few 
     eyebrows and then she went on down alone.  Now won't you bide it down by
     Baton Rouge, river queen rollin on.  Take that woman on down to New 
     Orleans, New Orleans.  Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the
     gulf.  She loves you big river more than me.  Now, I taught the weepin
     willow how to cry, cry, cry, and I showed the clouds how to cover up a 
     clear blue sky, and the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna 
     flood you big river, and I'm gonna sit right here until I die.
