Although this song ought to be played in the clawhammer picking style, the 
following chords can be used to play it by just strumming normally. However, it is 
possible to use the clawhammer picking technique on the these chords with a little 
manipulation of the picking sequence, etc...

C = -32010
G = 320002
Am = -02210
F = -03211
C/G = 332010
D7/F# = 200210
C7 = -32310


Capo 4, standard tuning.

Intro: C

          C              G              Am
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
F                      C/G G
Even you don't know by now,
       C                G             Am
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
D7/F#              G
It'll never do somehow.
          C                    C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
F                            D7/F#
Look out your window, aaaand I'll be gone,
C/G        G            Am        F
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
    C/G         G               C
But don't think twice, it's all right.


HARMONICA SOLO (You can just strum C)


C                        G               Am
And It ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
    F             C/G      G
The light I never knowed,
C                      G               Am
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
D7/F#                        G
I'm on the dark side of the road.
      C                                  C7
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say,
   F                         D7/F#
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
    C/G      G            Am         F
But we never did too much talking anyway,
    C/G         G               C
But don't think twice, it's all right.


      C               G              Am
So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
         F            C/G   G
Like you never done before,
       C               G              Am
And It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
D7/F#                G
I can't hear you any more.
      C                         C7
I'm a-thinking and a-wonderin', walking down the road,
  F                     D7/F#
I once loved a woman, a child I am told,
  C/G         G             Am        F
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul,
C/G             G               C
But don't think twice, it's all right.


HARMONICA SOLO (You can just play C, again)

C        G        Am
So looooong honey babe,
          F              C/G    G
Where I'm bound, I can't tell.
C         G          Am
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
D7/F#                      G
So I'll just say fare thee well.
C                            C7
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind,
    F                         D7/F# 
You could've done better, but I don't mind,
C/G            G         Am       F
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
    C/G         G               C
But don't think twice, it's all right.
