Ocean by The Velvet Underground

This is the same song as the previous version (transcribed from Fully Loaded)
but has a tuning more similar to the song heard on the album VU (the older 
version of the song)

E    G    A    G    E

E              G
Here comes the ocean
         A                G
And the waves down by the sea
E              G
Here comes the ocean
        A                      G
And the waves, where have they been?

E                 D
Lying here on the beach
                  C
With you it seems out of reach
              A
It could just drive me crazy
E             D
You're such a lazy son
               C
But you're the only one
             A
I could stay here forever...

       E              A
...But here comes the waves
E           A
Down by the shore
E           G
Washing our eyes
          A               G
Then it's gone, just once more

E                   G            A            G 
Down by the sea
E                   G            A            G 
Down by the sea

E              G             A
Here comes the ocean and the waves
            G
Down by the sea
E              G             A
Here comes the ocean and the waves
                G
Where have they been?

E                 D
Lying down on the beach
               C
It seems out of reach
                 A
Doesn't it just, drive you crazy
E                 D
You know that you feel so strong
                C
But you know it won't be long
             A
Til it's all underwater...

E                     A
...But here comes the waves
E           A
Down by the shore
E            G
Washing our eyes
         A               G
Til it's gone, just once more

E                   G            A            G 
Down by the sea
E                   G            A            G 


Db   B   A

Db   B   A

E     A              E
Here come the waves
E     A              E
Here come the waves
E     A              E
Here come the waves
