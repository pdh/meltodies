G
Down in Dallas near the Palace
                       D 
I met a boy who was so cute

I loved his hugging I loved his kissing
                            G  
As we sat in his little red coupe


He said tell me confidentially
                     C 
How much do you love me
                          G
Well I thought awhile and then I smiled
    D                                 G 
And this is what I told him don't-cha see


I love you honey I love your money
                  D
I love your automobile

I love you baby I don't mean maybe
                             G
You're the sweetest thing on wheels


I love your kisses I wouldn't miss it
                C
No matter how I feel
                   G
I love you honey I love your money
     D                        G 
Most of all I love your automobile

Instrumental (several verses)
