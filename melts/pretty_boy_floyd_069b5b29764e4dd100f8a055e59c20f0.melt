Pretty Boy Floyd

This is one of Woody Guthrie's most famous songs, which Bob 
Dylan recorded in 1988 for an album called Folkways: A 
Vision Shared (A Tribute to Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly).  

Besides Pretty Boy Floyd, the CD has a few other great songs
for acoustic guitar:  Bruce Springsteen sings I Ain't Got No
Home; Arlo Guthrie does East Texas Red; and Emmylou Harris 
sings Hobo's Lullaby.

Intro:
Intersperse these notes with strumming.  It's not too 
complicated, but it's harder than it might seem to do it as 
cleanly as Dylan does, at least to me.  The riff in the 
first measure is played twice after each two-line verse.  
Besides that, it's all just energetic strumming.
