Angel Band chords
Johnny Cash (traditional gospel)

E A/E  2x

   E             A       E
My latest sun is sinking fast
           B7     E
My race is nearly run
                    A       E
My strongest trials now are past
           B7    E
My triumph has begun

B7        E
Oh, come, angel band
B7        E7        E
Come and around me, stand
    A                    E
Oh, bear me away on your snow white wings
        B7     E   E7
To my immortal home
    A                    E
Oh, bear me away on your snow white wings
        B7     E
To my immortal home

     E                A        E
Iâ€™ve almost gained my heavenly Home
          B7     E
My spirit loudly sings
                A         E
The Holy Ones behold they come
           B7       E
I hear the sound of wings

B7        E
Oh, come, angel band
B7        E7        E
Come and around me, stand
    A                    E
Oh, bear me away on your snow white wings
        B7     E   E7
To my immortal home
    A                    E
Oh, bear me away on your snow white wings
        B7     E
To my immortal home

Optional verse:

Oh, bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And brings me victory

Oh, come, angel band
Come and around me, stand
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
