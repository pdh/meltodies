         C#2
When the dream came
  F#                     C#2
I held my breath with my eyes closed
                       F#
I went insane, like a smoke ring day
         C#2
When the wind blows
      F#                  C#2
Now I won't be back till later on
     F#       C#2       G#
If I do come back at all
         B     F#      *     
But you know me, and I miss you now

E|5
B|7
G|6  then play this chord, don’t know the name *
D|7  
A|5
E|5

In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came, and you had a
Chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now
