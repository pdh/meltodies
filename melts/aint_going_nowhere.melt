Subject: Bob Dylan - You Ain't Going Nowhere (chords)



You ain't going nowhere
Bob Dylan

G                     Am
Clouds so swift, the rain won't lift
     C                      G
The gates won't close, the railings froze
                    Am
Get your mind off wintertime
 C                  G
You ain't going nowhere 

Ooo-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come
Ooh, ooh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair

I don't care how many letters they sent
The morning came and the morning went
Pick up your money, pack up your tent,
You ain't going nowhere

Ooo-wee...

Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes 
Strap yourself to the tree with roots
You ain't going nowhere

Ooo-wee...

Gengis Khan he could not keep
All his kings supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it

Ooo-wee...
