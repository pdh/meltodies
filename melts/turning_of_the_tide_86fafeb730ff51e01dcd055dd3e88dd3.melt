Turning of the Tide, Richard Thompson
transcribed by phillip@princeton.edu


F
How many boys, one night stands
                                   C
How many lips, how many hands have held you
         Bb            C
Like I'm holding you tonight

F
Too many nights staying up late
Too much powder, too much paint
       C                   Bb             C
Oh you can't hide from the Turning of the Tide

Dm       F                 Bb
Did they run their fingers up and down your shabby dress
Dm       F                Bb              C
Did they find some tender moment there in your caress?

F
Boys all say you look so fine
Don't come back for a second time
    C                   Bb             C
You can't hide from the Turning of the Tide

Poor little sailor boy, never set eyes on a woman before
Did he tell you that he'd love you, darling, for ever more?

Pretty little shoes, cheap perfume
Creaking bed in the hotel room
You can't hide from the Turning of the Tide

Did they run their fingers up and down your shabby dress
Did they find some tender moment there in your caress?

Boys all say you look so fine
Don't come back for a second time
You can't hide from the Turning of the Tide

Ending                               F
