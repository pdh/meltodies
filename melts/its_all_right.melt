                G
Oh, It´s all right
Bm                   Em
It's all right, it's all right
             C
Honey, it´s all right
         G
Long as I know
                    A           
Long as I know that you love me
       G                  D7
Honey, it´s all right 


              G
It´s all right
         Bm             Em
It's all right, it's all right
            C
Honey, it´s all right
         G
Long as I know
                   A
Long as I know that you love me
      G                  D7
Baby, it´s all right

Note: it's same chord progression throughout the whole song

Oh, my friends tell me
That you found somebody new
They report to me
Every little thing that you do

But as long as you tell me
That it´s all untrue
Baby, it´s all right

Oh, It´s all right
It's all right, it's all right
Believe when I say it´s all right
Long as I know
Long as I know that you love me
Baby, it´s all right

Oh, oh, oh

One more thing I want you to know
If you ever worry, if you´re all alone
Just remember, darling
That I´m as near as your telephone

And if you need me, honey
All you've got to do is to call me
Believe me, it´s all right

Oh, It´s all right
It's all right, it's all right
Honey, it´s all right
Long as I know
Long as I know that you love me
Baby, it´s all right

Oh, help me to tell her one more time

It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right
Honey, long, long, long as I know
Long as I know that you love me...
