      C              Am
Go on girl take your chances
        Dm                             G7
See how long you can go on from man to man
      E                                  Am
I can read the lines between your stolen glances
      D                                   G7
And I know it's time to fold this loosing hand
             C            G7          C               G7
Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
       C                  F                 G7
Of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play
     C                E             Am         F
You've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
        C           G7
And you've only the devil to pay

             G7
'You've been flying so high you don't know
                         C
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
         D7
But some day you'll look down
                                       G7
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
         C                G7           C          G7
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
   C            F              G7
Forsaken in the naked light of day
            C                  E            Am     F
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
        C                G7
And you've still got the devil to pay

          C                 Am
Join your friends while you got 'em
          Dm                               G7
Cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
          E                                Am
You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
        D                                 G7
And I'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way
         C           G7                C       G7
But when you hit the ground don't come looking around
        F             G7
For the pieces of the love you threw away
           C            E                Am      F
That's the price of the high life you're livin'
        C             G7
And you still got the devil to pay
