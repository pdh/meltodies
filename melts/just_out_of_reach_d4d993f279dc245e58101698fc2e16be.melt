A
Love that runs away from me
                       E7
Dreams that just won't let me be 
 
Blues that keep on botherin' me
                       A
Chains that just won't set me free
                                   D
Too far away from you and all your charms
     E7                          A   D  A  E7
Just out of reach of my two open arms
 
A 
Each night in dreams I see your face
              E7
Memories time cannot erase
 
Then I awake and find you gone
                A
I'm so blue and all alone
                                   D
So far away from lips so sweet and warm
     E7                          A   D  A  E7
Just out of reach of my two open arms
 
A 
That lonesome feelin' all the time
               E7
Knowing you cannot be mine
 
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
                   A
Vows that we could never keep
                                    D
Too far away from lips so sweet and warm
     E7                          A    D  A
Just out of reach of my two open arms


     E7                          D     A
Just out of reach of my two open arms
