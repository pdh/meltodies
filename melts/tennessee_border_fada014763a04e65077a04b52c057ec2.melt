TENNESSEE BORDER

(CAPO ON 4TH. FRET)

(I.)
    G                            D7
Her eyes were blue, her hair was auburn.

                            G
Her smile was like an angel fair.

                         D7
She was her daddy's only daughter.

                 G      G7
On the Tennessee border.



(chorus,)

      C                                   G
  One night I took a ride just across the line.

    A7
  I picked her up in a pick-up truck.

          D                   D7
  And she broke this heart of mine.

      G                 D7
  Her mama said, "Nooo, she's my only daughter"!

                                      G
  But we got married at the Tennessee border.



(II.)
                        D7
The roses were blooming there on the border.

                     G
The moon was shining there.

                             D7
Her personality made me want her.

                 G
On the Tennessee border.



(repeat chorus)
