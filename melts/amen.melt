Amen Chords By Leonard Cohen
C#m                                                   F#m
Tell me again when I've been to the river and I've taken the edge off my thirst
C#m                                             F#m
Tell me again we're alone &amp; I'm listening I'm listening so hard that it hurts

[Chorus:]
A
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
E
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
B                       A
Tell me again tell me over and over
G#7
Tell me you want me then
C#m     F#m    C#m    F#m
Amen

Tell me again when the victims are singing
And Laws of Remorse are restored
Tell me again that you know what I'm thinking
But vengeance belongs to the lord

[Chorus]

Tell me again when the day has been ransomed and night has no right to begin
Try  me again when the angels are panting and scratching the door to come in


[Chorus]

Tell me again when the filth of the butcher is washed in the blood of the lamb
Tell me again when the rest of the culture has passed thru' the Eye of the Camp

[Chorus]
