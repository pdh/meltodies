    D              A
On A Monday I was Ar-rested (Uh-huh)
     A                        D
On A Tuesday they locked me in Jail (Poor Boy)
     D                         A
On A Wednesday my trial was at-tested
         A                                             D
And on a Thursday they said guilty as the judge's Gavel fell

      D                          A
I Got stripes, Stripes around my shoulders
      A                       D
I got chains, Chains around my feet
      D                          A
I got stripes, Stripes around my shoulders
         A                                         D  
And them chains them chains they're bout to drag me down

     D                         A
On A Monday I Got My Stripe-ed Britches
     A                         D
On A Tuesday I Got My Ball And Chain
     D                             A
On A Wednesday I'm Workin' Diggin' Ditches
     A                                              D
On A Thursday Lord I Begged 'Em Not To Knock Me Down Again

      D                          A
I Got stripes, Stripes around my shoulders
      A                       D
I got chains, Chains around my feet
      D                          A
I got stripes, Stripes around my shoulders
         A                                           D - E - E - E - E 
And them chains them chains they're bout to drag me down

     E                       Bb
On a Monday My momma came to see me
     Bb                             E
On a Tuesday they caught me with a file
     E                         Bb
On a Wednesday im down in soli-tary
     Bb                                         E
On A Thursday I Start On Bread And Water For A While

      E                          Bb
I Got stripes, Stripes around my shoulders
      Bb                        E
I got chains, Chains around my feet
      E                          Bb
I got stripes, Stripes around my shoulders
         Bb                                          E  
And them chains them chains they're bout to drag me down
