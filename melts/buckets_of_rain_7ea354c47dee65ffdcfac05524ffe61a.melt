Buckets of rain
E
Buckets of tears
E
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears
A                          E
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
B               A     G#m        F#m   E
You got all the love, honey baby I can stand

E
I been meek
    E
And hard like an oak
     E
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke
A                                      E
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
   B        A   G#m        F#m     E
If you want me, honey baby I'll be here

  E
I like your smile
         E
And your fingertips
  E
I like the way that you move your lips
  A                             E
I like the cool way you look at me
B           A           G#m         F#m E
Everything about you is bringing me misery

Little red wagon
E
Little red bike
  E
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like
  A                                   E
I like the way you love me strong and slow
    B          A        G#m        F#m    E
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby when I go

Life is sad
E
Life is a bust
E
All ya can do is do what you must
    A                                E
You do what you must do and ya do it well
     B         A    G#m         F#m       E
I'll do it for you, honey baby, can't you tell?
