Verse 1: 
         D 
      Do you remember Cactus Texas 
 
      Nothing but a wide place in the road 
 
      Eighteen wheelers never go there 
 
      Main Street's just too narrow for the load 
                  G 
      A little town of honest people 
                                       D 
      Some we haven't seen for quite awhile 
 
      I was young and restless 
                A                                  D  
      And we both were full of dreams and runnin' wild 
 
Verse 2: 
         D 
      We left our old hometown and family 
 
      Barely had a nickel to our name 
 
      We were out to win the world 
 
      Not once looking back or losing aim 
                    G 
      We hit the big town and the big time 
                                    D  
      Not a lot of effort in the deal 
 
      But in the bargain we lost touch 
                      A                            D 
      With one another and old feelings that were real 
 
Verse 3: 
         D 
      In a big house up on easy street 
       
      Where too much never seems to be enough 
       
      We're not the same two people 
 
      Far away from all the days when the times were rough 
            G  
      Including you and i 
                                      D 
      Everything is separated by a wall 
           
      It's not something we can talk about 
            A                            D 
      In fact we seldom even talk at all 
 
Verse 4: 
                  G    
      I don't think we realize 
                                    D 
      How or why we ever came this far 
                  D/ 
      Let's go back to Cactus Texas 
              A/  
      Maybe once we're there 
                               D/   
      We'll find out where we are
