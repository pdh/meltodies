VERSE:

Well you said you've had enough you said that you were leavin'
E      A
I said shove off honey baby I ain't grievin'
E                    
Pack your bags and pull out this evenin' 
E         F#        B7
There's a wide open road

E
On Saturday mornin' you were nowhere about
E        A
And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out 
A        E
I looked north, east, and west and then a-leadin' south
E       F#   B7   E     
I saw a wide open road

REFRAIN:
E
There's a wide open road
E            A              E
It's leadin' south from my abode
E      A                           E
If you stick around then turn your damper down
E            F#   B7   E
Or there's a wide open road

Well the reason I was lookin' for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty-cat he's still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went down
That wide open road

If you're gonna stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits out of a roll of dough
Everything's gone crazy since I told you to go 
Down the wide open road

REFRAIN:
There's a wide open road
And honey I want you to know
You can look down south or you can turn back home
And there's a wide open road
