Subject: CRD: What_can_i_do_for_you BY Bob Dylan



Hope you enjoy this offering it's taken from the LP Saved - an album I feel
doesn't get enough credit, so I decided to give it a plug.  Its a song about
Dylan's conversion to christianity and what it means (meant!) to him. 
If you have any comments or find it useful please e-mail me to let me know.

Use Chord sequence 1
You have laid down you life for Me
What can I do for you?
You have explained every Mystery           
What can I do for you?

Use Chord sequence 2
Soon as a man is born you know the sparks begin to fly
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Well, youv'e done it all and there's no more any one can be dared enough to do
What can I do for you?

Interlude

Chord sequence 1
You have given all there is to give
What can I give to you?
You have given me life to live
How can I live for you?

Chord sequence 2
I know all about poison
I know about fiery doubts
I don't care how rough the road is
Show me where to start
What ever please you tell it to my heart
Well I don't deserve it but I did make it through
What can I do for you?
