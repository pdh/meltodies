Verse 1:
           A                    D            A
	It's the same old tune,fiddle and guitar
                                  D
	Where do we take it from here
           A                  D          A
	Rhinestone suits and new shiney cars
                                      D
	We've been the same way for years
                      A
	We need to change


Verse 2:
           A          D                    A
	Somebody told me when i got to Nashville
                                D
	Son you finally got it made
           A                    D                     A
	Old Hank made it here,we're ll sure that you will
                                            D
	But i don't think Hank done it this way
                                         A
	I don't think Hank done it this way


Verse 3:
           A                       D                A
	Ten years down the road,making one night stands
                                D
	Speeding my young life away
           A                       D           A
	Tell me one more time just so i understand
                                       D
	Are you sure Hank done it this way
                                      A
	Did Ol'Hank really do it this way?


Verse 4:
           A                       D           A
	I've seen the world with a five piece band
                                   D
	Looking at the back side of me
           A                      D              A
	Singing my songs and one of his now and then
                                            D
	But i don't think Hank done it this way
                                           A
	No i don't think Hank done it this way.
