Intro: A

A                              D                         A     D-A
There's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas;
A       E                                                A
There's many a young boy who feels things he don't comprehend.
A                                  D                      A     D-A
Well small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes,
A   E                                                       A
No, small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.

A                              D                          A         D-A
Well I believe in my soul that inside every man there's a feminine,
A   E                                                     A
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear.
A                             D                            A     D-A
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he does with his women,
A       E                                                       A     C#
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.

A                      D                     A     D-A
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other 
E                                              A     C#
What did you think those saddles and boots was about?
A                               D
There's many a cowboy who don't understand 
                                  A         D-A
the way that he feels towards his brother,
E                                                     A
Inside every cowboy there's a lady who'd love to slip out.

A                              D                         A        D-A
Ten men for each woman was the rule way back when on the prairie,
A   E                                                            A
And somehow those cowboys must have kept themselves warm late at night.
A                       D                     A         D-A
Cowboys are famous for getting riled up about fairies,
A   E                                                 A          C#
But I'll tell you the reason a big strong man gets so uptight:


A                      D                     A     D-A
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other 
E                                                          A    C#
That's why they wear leather, and Levi's and belts buckled tight.
A                               D
There's many a cowboy who don't understand 
                                  A         D-A
the way that he feels towards his brother;
E                                                     A
There's many a cowboy who's more like a lady at night.

A                                D                         A       D-A
Well there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper,
A   E                                                    A
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead:
A                               D                       A     D-A
When you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister
A     E                                                   A      C#
Don't mess with the lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.

A                      D                     A     D-A
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other 
E                                                                 A    C# 
Even though they take speed and drive pickups and shoot their big guns;
A                               D
There's many a cowboy who don't understand 
                                  A         D-A
the way that he feels towards his brother;
E                                                       A(arpeggio)          
There's many a cowboy who keeps quiet about things he's done.
