Capo on the 1st fret.


Chorus:(1st one almost a capella)
            E                    A              E
	If your feeling salty,then i'm your tequila
                                     B7              E
	If you've got the freedom then i've got the time
                                      A            E
	There ain't nothing sweeter than naked emotions
                                    B7           E
	So you show me yours and i'll show you mine


Verse 1:
           A                                                  E
	Now mam i know this ain't all that you've ever been used to
            B7                                                E
	You with your rings on your fingers and time on your hands
           A                                                  E
	Sometimes it's nice to have somebody nice to be close to
            B7                                       E
	I know i've been there before you and i understand


Chorus.


Verse 2:
           A                                              E
	I know that i'm not the answer to all of your questions
             B7                                           E
	Lord knows you know you wish you were the answer to mine
           A                                                E
	But darling if you ain't a thing but a change in direction
             B7                                          E
	God knows i know you'll be someone i'm lucky to find

Chorus.
                                B7              E

	So you show me yours and i'll show you mine.
