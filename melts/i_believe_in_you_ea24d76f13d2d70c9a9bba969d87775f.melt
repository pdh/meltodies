They ask me how I feel, and if my love is real
                     G      D
And how I know I'll make it through
                                                                    C
And they, they look at me and frown, they'd like to drive from this town
                     G
They don't want me around
            D           G/D  D
'Cause I believe in you

D
They show me to the door, they say don't come back no more
                              G       D
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
                                                C
And I walk out on my own, a thousand miles from home
                   G
But I don't feel alone
            D           G/D  D
'Cause I believe in you

     C           G                              D
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
     C           G                   D
I believe in you even though we be apart
     C           G                   D
I believe in you even on the morning after
G             A   D/F#   G                  A       D/F#     G
Oh, when the dawn is nearing, oh, when the night is disappearing
         A        D/F#       G     A
Oh, this feelings still here in my heart

D
Don't let me drift to far, keep me where you are
                    G     D
Where I will always be renewed
                                                                C
And that which you've given me today is worth more than I could pay
                        G
And no matter what they say
     D           G/D  D
I believe in you

     C           G                    D
I believe in you when winter turns to summer
     C                G              D
I believe in you when white turns to black
     C           G                   D
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
G              A     D/F#       G                 A       D/F#   G
Oh, though the earth may shake me, oh, though my friends forsake me
         A         D/F#     G     A   
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back

D
Don't let me change my heart, keep me set apart
                        G     D
From all the plans they do pursue
                                                     C
And I, I don't mind the pain, don't mind the driving rain
                 G
I know I will sustain
            D           G/D  D
'Cause I believe in you
