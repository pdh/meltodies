G D EM
We've come to the time in the season
C G
When family and friends gather near
D EM
To offer a prayer of Thanksgiving
C D
For blessings we've known through the year
C G
To join hands and thank the creator
C D
And now when Thanksgiving is due
G D EM
This year when I count my blessings
C D G
I'm thanking the Lord He made you

D EM
This year when I count my blessings
C D G
I'm thanking the Lord He made you

I'm grateful for the laughter of children
The sun and the wind and the rain
The color of blue in your sweet eyes
The sight of a high ball and train
The moon rise over a prairie
Old love that you've made new
This year when I count my blessings
I'm thanking the Lord He made you
This year when I count my blessings
I'm thanking the Lord He made you

And when the time comes to be going
It won't be in sorrow and tear
I'll kiss you goodbye and I'll go on my way
Grateful for all of the years
I thank for all that you gave me
For teaching me what love can do
Thanksgiving day for the rest of my life
I'm thanking the Lord He made you
Thanksgiving day for the rest of my life
I'm thanking the Lord He made you
