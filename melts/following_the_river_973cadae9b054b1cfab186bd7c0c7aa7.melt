Sounding Key is F#, these chords are in G so, guitar should be tuned half step 
down to play along with the record.

Intro
G Gsus C x 2

G        Gsus              C
There's something I should tell you
G        Gsus                   C
Why don't you sit down in that chair
G              D/F# 
You're looking good today
   Em                  A                    D     Dsus D7
I love they way your comb's tucked in your hair

G                   Bm/F# 
My cards are on the table
Em       G/D                C
But the drinks have all run out
G                 D/F#           Em
There's been some people on this road
         A               D         Dsus D7
We made really quite a crowd

G                     Bm/F#
It's hard to break it gently
Em       G/D                 C
But I've really thought it through
G       D/F#               Em         A           D  Dsus          D7   
I don't think there's much future left for me and you, me and you

G        F             C     Em/B  
I'll be following the river
Am       G                   F
Till it joins hands with the sea
C       Em/B            Am       D
I'll be thinking of you all the time
            D                    G   Gsus C  G Gsus C
Cause you always saw the best in me

G                 Bm/F#
You'll probably forget me
Em       G/D           C
And I'll fade into the fog
G      D/F#       Em               A            D  Dsus             D7
Just a face disappearing without trace I'll be lost, I'll be lost

G                      Bm/F#
One day I'll hear some laughter
Em    G/D            C
In an out of town cafe
G       D/F#              Em
I'll be reaching for your number
         A                D
I'll be calling out your name 
Dsus                    D7
Calling out your name

G        F             C     Em/B  
I'll be following the river
Am       G                   F
Till it joins hands with the sea
C       Em/B                      Am            D
I'll be thinking of you, I'll be dreaming all about you
            D                    G   Gsus C  G Gsus C
Cause you always saw the best in me
