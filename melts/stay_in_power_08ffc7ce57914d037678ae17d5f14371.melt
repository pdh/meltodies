STAYIN' POWER


G  B  C  A(addB)  A  

G               B7
Our love, baby, feels so right
C                          A
When you're smilin' in the morning light
G       B             C  
I ain't leavin' no way
A             G             C/G  G  C/G
'Cause we got stayin' power
G       C/G  G  C/G
You and I
G             C/G  G  C/G
Stayin' power            
        G     C/G  G
through thick and thin
G             C/G  G  C/G
Stayin' power
G       C/G  G  C/G
You and I
G             C/G  G  C/G
Stayin' power            
        G     C/G  G
through thick and thin

Gold and diamonds say you're mine
But true love opens the gates of time
And as we go on our way

We got stayin' power
You and I
Stayin' power through thick and thin
Stayin' power
You and I
Stayin' power through thick and thin
