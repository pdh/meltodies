In Spite of Ourselves- John Prine
His Verse:
[C]She don't like her eggs all runny
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
She [F]looks down her nose at money
She [C]gets it on like the Easter Bunny
[G]She's my baby, I'm her honey
I'm never gonna let her [C]go

Her Verse:
[C]He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
He [F]ain't too sharp but he gets things done
[C]Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
[G]He's my baby, And I'm his honey
Never gonna let him [C]go
 
Combo Chorus:
In spite of [F]ourselves
We'll end up a'sittin' on a [C]rainbow
Against all [G]odds
Honey, we're the big door [C]prize
We're gonna [F]spite our noses
Right off of our [C]faces
There won't be nothin' but big old [G]hearts
Dancin' in our [C]eyes. [G]  [C]
 
His Verse:
[C]She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
She [F]likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
[C]Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs
[G]She takes a lickin' but she keeps on tickin'
I'm never gonna let her [C]go.
 
 
 
 
Her Verse:
[C]He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a whacked out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
[F]He's sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
[C]When payday comes, he's howlin' at the moon
[G]But he's my baby.  I don't mean maybe
Never gonna let him [C]go
 
In spite of [F]ourselves
We'll end up a'sittin' on a [C]rainbow
Against all [G]odds
Honey, we're the big door [C]prize
We're gonna [F]spite our noses
Right off of our [C]faces
There won't be nothin' but big old [G]hearts
Dancin' in our [C]eyes.  
 
[Chorus]
 
There won't be nothin' but big old [G]hearts
Dancin' in our [C]eyes.
