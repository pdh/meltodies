G                                     Cadd9
Well, i was feelin sad and kinda blue
   D
I didn't know what i was gonna do
    G                            Cadd9
The communists were comin' around
                 D
They were in the air

They were on the ground
                               G       Cadd9       D        G      
They were all over.
