Em               D   Ds4 D   Em
Are you goin' to Scarborough Fair?
G        Em        G A       Em
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Em       G                   D     Ds4 D Ds4 D
Remember me to one who lives there
Em       D                  Em
She once was a true love of mine

Em                    D Ds4 D Em
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
G        Em        G A       Em
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)
Em         G               D     Ds4 D Ds4 D
Without no seams nor needlework
(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
Em          D                 Em
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)

Em                     D Ds4 D Em
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)
G        Em        G A       Em
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
Em               G                 D       Ds4 D Ds4 D
Between the salt water and the sea strands
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
Em          D                 Em
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Em                       D Ds4 D   Em
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
(War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)
G        Em        G A       Em
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
    Em        G                 D       Ds4 D Ds4 D
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Em          D                 Em
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Em               D   Ds4 D   Em
Are you goin' to Scarborough Fair?
G        Em        G A       Em
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Em       G                   D     Ds4 D Ds4 D
Remember me to one who lives there
Em       D                  Em
She once was a true love of mine
