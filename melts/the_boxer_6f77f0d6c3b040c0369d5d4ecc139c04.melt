Title: The Boxer
Artist: Simon and Garfunkel


C                                             Am
I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
G
I have squandered my resistance
     F                                C
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
           Am            G                 F
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C       G F Em Dm C
And disregards the rest  m m m m ..

C                                                       Am
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
         G
In the company of strangers
	F	                           C
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
       Am           G              F
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
                        C
Where the ragged people go
	    G          F   Em          C
Looking for the places only they would know

C Am G Am G F C
Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie

C                                                Am
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
             G
But I get no offers
          F                              C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
       Am                G                F
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
                    C
I took some comfort there
G                  F  C
Lie lie lie lie la


  C                                                   Am
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
  G                         F                        C
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
 Em           Am          G
Leading meeeeeeeeee to going home.

 C                                                Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
       G                      F
And he carries a reminder of every glove that laid him down
   C                                            Am
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
  G
I am leaving, I am leaving
                     C
But the fighter still remains
   G F Em Dm C
M m m m...

C Am G Am G F C
Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie..etc
