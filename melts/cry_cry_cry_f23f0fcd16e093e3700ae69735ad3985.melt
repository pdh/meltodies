    G
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
                                 A           D
I think you only live to see the lights of town.
  G
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
C                                                  D           G
When the lights have lost their glow, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.

G
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
                                A               D
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
       G
You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye, bye, bye,"
      C                                  D            G
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,

G
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
          C                          G
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
             D            G
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

  G
I lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in.
                                        A       D
You stay a little while and then you're gone again.
     G
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie.
     C                               D            G
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.


G
When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you.
                                   A               D   
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
G
I'll tell you no then you'll ask me why, why, why?
     C                                   D            G
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.


G
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then,
      C                           G
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
             D            G
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.
