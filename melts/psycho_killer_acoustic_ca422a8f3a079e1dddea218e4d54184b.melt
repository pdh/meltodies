A                                     C
  I can't seem to face up to the facts
A                                        C
  I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax
A                                     C
  I can't sleep cause my bed's on fire
A
  Don't touch me I'm a real live wire
 
 
CHORUS
F               G
  Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est
Am
  Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa  better
F             G                C
  Run run run run run run run away
F               G
  Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est
Am
  Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa  better

A                                                C 
You start a conversation, you can't even finish it
A                                                   C
You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything
A                                            C
When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed
A
Say something once, why say it again?

 
CHORUS
 
 
Bm                        C
Ce que j'ai fais, ce soir la
Bm                        C
Ce que j'ai fais, ce soir la
A
Realisant, mon espoir
G
Je me lance, vers la goire
A             G
Okay
A                G
Ayayayayayayayay
A                             G
We are vain and we are blind
A                                      G
I hate people when they're not polite

"crazy Psycho-dellic jam sesh"

at the beginning theres a ever so quiet D chord on the 8th fret. or something like that.


Paul Zimmerman? did this and i just added the D's, thank him.
