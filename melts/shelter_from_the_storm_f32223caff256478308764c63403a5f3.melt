E                B         A               E
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
     E               B              A                     
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
  E                B             A                
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form.
      E                    B        A                E
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
