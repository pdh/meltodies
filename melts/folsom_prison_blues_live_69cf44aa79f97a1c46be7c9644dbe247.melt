                           Folsom Prison Blues (Live)
                                 by Johnny Cash

     I hear the train a-comin.  It's rollin round the bend, and I ain't seen
                                                  Bb
     the sunshine since I don't know when.  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and
                        F               C           
     time keeps draggin on.  But that train keeps a-rollin on down the San
       F
     Antone.  When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son, always be a good
                                            Bb
     boy, don't ever play with guns, but I shot a man in Reno just to watch
          F            C                                            F
     him die.  When I hear that whistle blowin, I hang my head and cry.

     I'll bet there's rich folks eatin on a fancy dinin car.  They're probly
     drinkin coffee and smokin big cigars, well, I know I had it comin, I
     know I can't be free, but those people keep a-movin, and that's what 
     tortures me.  Well, if they free me from this prison, if that railroad
     train was mine, I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line, far
     from Folsom Prison.  That's where I want to stay.  And I'd let that 
     lonesome whistle blow my blues away.
