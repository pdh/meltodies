Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues chords
Bob Dylan *

D C G  2x

            G
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez,
         C           G
and it's Easter time too

And your gravity fails,
    C                         G
and negativity don't pull you through

Don't put on any airs,
            C                     G
when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
         D
They got some hungry women there, 
         C                       G
and they really make a mess outa you.


Now if you see Saint Annie,
C                        G
please tell her thanks a lot

I cannot move,
   C                    G
my fingers are all in a knot

I don't have the strength,
   C                       G
to get up and take another shot
       D
And my best friend, my doctor,
      C                        G
won't even say what it is I've got.


Sweet Melinda,
    C                                G
the peasants call her the goddess of gloom

She speaks good English,
          C                     G
and she invites you up into her room

And you're so kind,
    C                            G
and careful not to go to her too soon
        D
And she takes your voice,
    C                         G
and leaves you howling at the moon.


Up on Housing Project Hill,
     C                 G
it's either fortune or fame

You must pick up one or the other,
       C                                   G
though neither of them are to be what they claim

If you're lookin' to get silly,
    C                                G
you better go back to from where you came
            D
Because the cops don't need you,
    C                   G
and man they expect the same.


Now all the authorities,
C                          G
they just stand around and boast

How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms,
     C           G
into leaving his post

And picking up Angel who,
C                          G
just arrived here from the coast
    D
Who looked so fine at first,
    C                        G
but left looking just like a ghost.

G C G C G C G D C G

I started out on burgundy,
    C                   G
but soon hit the harder stuff

Everybody said they'd stand behind me,
         C        G
when the game got rough

But the joke was on me,
          C                    G
there was nobody even there to bluff
          D
I'm going back to New York City,
  C                    G
I do believe I've had enough.

D C G  4x
