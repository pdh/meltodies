(Spoken) 
G
I was thumbin' a ride one Saturday mornin' 
       C
Out of Nashville totin' my sack 
          D7
I lent my car to a gal that lived in Chattanooga 
                                     G
And she hadn't ever brought it back.  
 
She was drinkin' pretty heavy, when I let her have it 

Hope she knows it was only a loan 

Ain't no tellin' what I might have told her back at the time, 

But that old car was also my home. 
 
About five miles out I was gettin' kinda tired 

Sweatin' hard and feelin' kinda weak 

I woke up with no cigarettes or nothin' to drink 

And I hadn't had a bite to eat. 
 
My nerves was so quick I couldn't tell where I was shakin' 

Then a set of brakes sang my song 

Some fellow stuck his head out a '51 Chevy 

And hollered "Hey man, come on." 
 
I tole 'em I was headin' down to Chattanooga 

They said hop in, we're goin' there too 

And the way they took off in a cloud of smoke 

I still ain't believin' it was true. 
 
They had their windows down, and I was sittin' in the back 

With my tongue still hung in my throat 

He was hittin' just about a hundred and ten  

And he said, "Man, what you think of this boat?" 
 
Well, there was two semi's a-strugglin' up ahead 

One tryin' to pass the other 

They had the whole road blocked so he passed 'em on  the right 

And let me tell you somethin' brother. 
 
I was so nervous my that teeth was clickin'  

There wasn't no way my head could think 

Then the one that was sittin' on the passenger side  

Turned and said, "Hey man, you want somethin' to  drink?" 
 
I just shook my head 'cause I couldn't talk 

He said OK and then he said cheers 

Them fools was drinkin' whiskey and wine 

And chasin' it down with beer. 
 
Well, I started sweatin' that old sticky sweat 

And I know I was white as a sheet 

Then one turned the radio on wide open 

And said, "Hey man, check that beat." 
 
By the time we reached the top of Monteagle 

I thought I heard a rumblin' sound 

And then I saw a sign that said 'FALLIN' ROCK' 

And right there I was floorboard bound. 
 
I was rollin' and squirmin' on the old floorboard 

Too weak to sit or stand 

And then the driver said "We're doin' a hundred and twenty 

Look here man, no hands!" 
 
I got up enough nerve to raise up and look 

By now there couldn't be no surprise, 

But his hair was blowin' all over my face 

And dandruff blowed in both eyes. 
 
He never did drive on the right or left 

He just kept on ridin' that line 

I rubbed my eyes and saw the prettiest thing 

The Chattanooga City Limit Sign. 
 
He slowed down and I said, "Mister please! 

I'd like to get off right here" 

He said, "Aw, ride on into town with us 

We'e gonna go down n' pick up some more beer." 
 
I said please once more and he stopped the car 

And then he handed me my sack 

Said they'd look for me on the road later on 

(In) Case I wanted to catch a ride back. 
 
I got out and sat down by the side of the road 

Feelin' sick and lookin' mighty pale 

I don't remember anything much after that 

But next mornin', I woke up in jail. 
 
I didn't know anybody in my cell, 

And didn't wanta ask why I was there 

But they all kept grinnin' and turnin' their heads 

And it was more than my head could bear. 
G
So I called the jailer and asked him to tell me 
          C
Why I was there, if he'd be so kind 
             D
He said, {S} {P} 

"For stoppin' traffic, while I was huggin' and kissin' 
                                  G
The Chattanooga City Limit Sign."
