C - you can play it like x32110

                           C
Take the ribbons from your hair
                         F
Shake it lose and let it fall
                         G
Lay it soft against your skin
                        C
Like the shadows on the wall

Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning bright
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

                              F
I don't care what's right or wrong
                    C
I don't try to understand
                     D
Let the devil take tomorrow
                     G    (/F /E /D  or   F Em Dm)
For tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
I don't care what's right or wrong
Help me make it through the night

[instrumental]

I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
For tonight I need a friend

I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
And today is also dead and gone
Help me make it through the night.
