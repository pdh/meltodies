The key and lyrics match the version of "Heaven" from the Talking Heads's movie 
"Stop Making Sense," but I don't have the original on hand to tell you which key 
that's in. The one from "The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads," for example, 
matches this almost exactly but it's played a half-step higher (D instead of Eb).

         Eb                Fm
         Everyone is trying to get to the bar
Bb                       Ab                     Eb
         The name of the bar, the bar is called heaven
                                  Fm
         The band in heaven plays my favorite song
Bb                            Ab                        Eb
         They played one more time, played it all night long

         Cm                  Bbm                  Db                    Ab
         Heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens
         Cm                  Bbm                  Db                    Ab
         Heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens

         Eb              Fm
         There is a party, everyone is there
Bb                     Ab                        Eb
         Everyone will leave at exactly the same time
                                Fm
         When this party's over, it will start again
         Bb              Ab                             Eb
         Will not be any different, will be exactly the same

         Cm                  Bbm                  Db                    Ab
         Heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens

         Eb                     Fm
         When this kiss is over, it will start again
Bb                       Ab                             Eb
         will not be any different, will be exactly the same
                              Fm        
         It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
Bb                        Ab                      Eb
         could be so exciting, could be this much fun

         Cm                  Bbm                  Db                    Ab
         Heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens
         Cm                  Bbm                  Db                    Ab
         Heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens
