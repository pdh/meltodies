I know this isnt right, but it sounds alot better to me on acoustic. Plus its alot 
easier for us beginners to play. I play a lot of my stuff by ear, and I cant read 
music. But here it goes... enjoy.


G  C  G  Em  Am  G

G                       C              G 
Just about a year ago  I set out on the road
                    Em           Am                   D
Seekin' my fame and fortune  And looking for a pot of gold
G               Em                  C                  G
Things got bad,  Things got worse  I Guess you know the tune
         Em              C         G      
Oh lord, stuck in Lodi again   


I rode in on a grey hound  I'll be walking out if I go
I was just passing through  Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money  Looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  


The man from the magazine  Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection  Ran out of songs to play
Came into town on a one night stand  Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
