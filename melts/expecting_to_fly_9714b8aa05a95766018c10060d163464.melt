EXPECTING TO FLY

A                       Em                 D
There you stood on the edge of your feather, 

              E
expecting to fly.

A                 Em
While I laughed, I wondered whether 

D                  E  A
I could wave goodbye,

 D                 G    
Knowin' that you'd gone. 

Am7           D7              
By the summer it was healing, 

G               C
we had said goodbye.

Am7                D7
All the years we'd spent with feeling 

G            C
ended with a cry, 

Cmaj7              C
Babe, ended with a cry, 

Cmaj7  Gmaj7           A 
Babe,     ended with a cry.


I tried so hard to stand 
as I stumbled and fell to the ground.
So hard to laugh as I fumbled 
and reached for the love I found,
knowin' it was gone.
If I never lived without you, 
now you know I'd die.
If I never said I loved you, 
now you know I'd try,
Babe,     now you know I'd try. 
Babe,     now you know I'd try, 

Cmaj7  G
Babe.
