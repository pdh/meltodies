My first submission to UG!!  I know this is 100% correct, the other tabs/chords 
seemed off a tad bit.  
I listened very closely to Dylan to find out what he's doing in this song.
I have outlined Learning this song with 4 very important steps, 
read EVERYTHING to sound like Dylan does.


1). PUT A CAPO ON THE 4TH FRET!!!  This song is in the key of E.  
The chord shapes are in the key of C, but the song is in E with the capo on 4 (E 
is 4 semitones from C).

2) Listen to the first 3 seconds of the song MANY TIMES! 
Listen before the harmonica and drums come in, they overpower the guitar sound and 
it's hard to hear.  
The chord pattern is hard to learn by just reading this lesson, so you need to 
listen to the song very very closely.

3) Chords: the chords are Am x02210, G6 320000, and F 133211.  
Even though the capo is on 4, the chord structures are the same.
As I said, the chords shapes are in C, but with the capo the song is in E.

4) Intro:  the intro is the same chord structure as the rest of the song except 
Dylan plucks the open A string, palm mutes/slaps, and then goes into the chords. 
If you learn the chord structure first, then the intro is easier to pickup on.


Am(4x)                 G6(1x) F(6x)     G6(2x)  (same thing through the whole song)
There must be some way out of here
Am              G6   F       G6
Said the joker to the thief
Am               G6  F         G6
There's too much confusion
Am             G6  F      G6
I can't get no relief

(same chords)

Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth

No reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke

But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too

Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
