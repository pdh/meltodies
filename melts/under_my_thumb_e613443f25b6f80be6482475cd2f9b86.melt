VERSE:
                F#m
      Under my thumb's
           E 
      The girl
           D 
      Who once had me down
                F#m
      Under my thumb's
           E
      The girl
                 D
      Who once pushed me around


CHORUS:
                   A
      It's down to me
           D                  B
      The difference in the clothes she wears
                  F#m
      It's down to me
                      E
      The change has come
             D         A
      She's under my thumb
      (Ain't it the truth babe)


VERSE:
      Under my thumb's
      A squirming dog
      Who just had her day
      Under my thumb's
      A girl
      Who has just
      Changed her ways

CHORUS:
      It's down to me (yes it is)
      The way she does just what she's told
      Down to me 
      The change has come
      She's under my thumb
      (It's all right)

VERSE:
      Under my thumb's
      A siamese cat of a girl
      Under my thumb 
      She's the sweetest pet
      In the world


CHORUS:
      It's down to me
      The way she talks 
      When she's spoken to
      Down to me
      The change has come
      She's under my thumb
      (Take it easy babe)


INSTRUMENTAL: SOLO over the VERSE chords


CHORUS:
       It's down to me
       The way she talks
       When she's spoken to
       Down to me
       The change has come
       She's under my thumb
       (It's all right)


VERSE:
       Under my thumb
       Her eyes
       Are just kept to herself
       Under my thumb
       Well, I -- I can still look
       At someone else
   

CHORUS:
       It's down to me
       The way she talks
       When she's spoken to
       Down to me
       The change has come
       She's under my thumb

*OUTRO:
       It's all right     }    *REPEAT and FADE OUT
       Take it easy babe  }
