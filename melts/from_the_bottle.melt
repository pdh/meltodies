/*************** FROM THE BOTTLE TO THE BOTTOM ****************/

written and performed by Kris Kristofferson.

Verse 1:
                         G
	You ask me if i'm happy now
                                 	D
	That's good as any joke i've heard

	It seems since i've seen you last
			  	           G
	I've done forgotten the meening of the words

	If happiness is empty rooms

	And drinkin' in the afternoon
				C
	Well i suppose i'm happy as a clown
	     D
	But if it's got a thing to do

	With smilin' of forgettin' you
				     G
	Well i don't guess that i could say i am


Chorus:
	 G
	Did you ever see a darling out a waken up alone
					D
	Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew

	When the water from the weeds that sop the paper
									 G
	He's been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from comin' through

	And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants
					     C
	Because he's never seen a single dream come true
		D
	That's the way that i've been feelin' since the day i started fallen

	From the bottle to the bottom stew by stew
				G
	Learnin' hard to live with losin' you


Verse 2:
	  G
	You wonder if i'm better off
				           D
	With freedom now to do the things i choose

	With all my times my own and
			                         G
	I got nothin' left but sleepin' time to lose

	There's no one here to carry on

	If i stay out the whole night lone
				  C
	Give a thinker's damn if i don't call
	    D
	I'm livin' like i wanted you

	And doin' things i wanna do
				         G
	And nothin' means a things to me at all


Chorus.
