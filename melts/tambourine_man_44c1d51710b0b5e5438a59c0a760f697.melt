	hey mister tambourine man, play a song for me
	         G      C       Am               D       D  G D
	in the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin you
	 
	  C                  D                    G            C
	though i know that evening's empire has returned into sand
	   G               C
	vanished from my hand
	      G                    C
	left me blindly here to stand
	           Am,    D
	but still not sleepin
	 C              D                 G          C
	my weariness amazes me - i'm branded on my feet
	      G           C
	i have no one to meet
             G                C
	and my ancient empty street's
	 Am		D
	too dead for dreamin
