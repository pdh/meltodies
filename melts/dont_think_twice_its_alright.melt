Tabbed by: Matt Denton (iammatt@gmail.c0m)

Tuning: 1/2 step Down


Intro (Pick the treble notes of the chords)
G, Em, C, D, G, D7

G                           Em
Ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
C                       D
  Like you never did before
G                           Em
Ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
A7                  D
  I can't hear you any more
G                                   G7
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
C                        A7
Look out your window and I'll be gone
G                         F#/G   Em
You're the reason why I'm travelin' on
G           D               G        D7
Don't think twice, it's all right


Walkin' down that long, lonesome road, gal
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just sorta wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's all right.

Ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
The light I've never known
Ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
You never did too much talkin' anyway
Don't think twice, it's all right

Ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe.
It don't matter anyhow.
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe.
If you don't know by now.
I'm a-thinkin and a-wondrin all the way down the road.
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told.
I gave her my heart But she wanted my soul.
So don't think twice, it's alright.

Notes:
The bass does most of the walking in the song, so I've tried to transcribe/arrange it to 
sound best on a solo acoustic guitar.
