You're tellin' everyone in town that I don't treat you right 
                C             D7                G 
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night 
     C                              G 
I'm losing you and you are all I've got  
         D7               G 
Thanks a lot    thanks a lot 
 
 
                      C                    D7 
It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you 
                 C                 D7                G 
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to 
     C                            G 
Yeah now you really got me on the spot  
          D7              G 
Thanks a lot     thanks a lot 
 
 
C                                   G 
Still I would forgive you if you'd let me  
D                            G 
I'd be glad if we could try again 
       C                              G 
But it seems that you're just out to get me 
        D                                G 
And it looks as if you're just about to win 
 
 
                   C      D7             G 
No matter what you do I always will love you 
     C                          D7              G 
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go 
           C                 D                  G 
And you're callin' me those things you know I'm not  
         D7                   G 
Thanks a lot        thanks a lot

G                  C     D7             G 
No matter what you do I always do love you 
    C                           D7               G 
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go 
   C              D7                G 
You say I'm happy but you know I'm not  
          D7                G       C       D  G 
Thanks a lot      thanks a lot      thanks a lot
