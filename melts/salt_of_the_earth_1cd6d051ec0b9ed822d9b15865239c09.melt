Salt Of The Earth chords
The Rolling Stones

E A  E A  E B  *

E     B            E            A  E
Let s drink to the hard working people
      B            E        A     
Let s drink to the lowly of birth
E          B            E            A E
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
      B            E           A
Let s drink to the salt of the earth

E     B              E           A   E
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
        B               E             A
Spare a thought for his back breaking work
E     B              E            A   E
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
    B                      E              A
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

    C#m             G#m
And when I search a faceless crowd
  C#m              G#m
A swirling mass of gray and
F#m
Black and white
G#m
They don t look real to me
A                     B7
In fact, they look so strange

E          B            E            A  E
Raise your glass to the hard working people
      B            E         A
Let s drink to the uncounted heads
E     B            E        A   E
Let s think of the wavering millions
    B                    E          A
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead

E       B               E            A  E
Spare a thought for the stay at-home voter
          B                    E      A     
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
E     B             E           A   E
And a parade of the gray suited grafters
            B         E   A     
A choice of cancer or polio

    C#m             G#m
And when I search a faceless crowd
  C#m              G#m
A swirling mass of gray and
F#m
Black and white
G#m
They don t look real to me
A                     B7
In fact, they look so strange

E     B            E            A  E
Let s drink to the hard working people 
      B            E        A     
Let s think of the lowly of birth
E       B               E         A   E
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
      B            E           A     
Let s drink to the salt of the earth

E     B            E            A  E
Let s drink to the hard working people
      B            E           A     
Let s drink to the salt of the earth
E     B            E            A   E
Let s drink to the two thousand million
      B            E         A     
Let s think of the humble of birth
