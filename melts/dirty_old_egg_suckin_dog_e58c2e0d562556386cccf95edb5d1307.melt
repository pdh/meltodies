Egg Sucking Dog – Johnny Cash

Found on Johhny Cash at Folsom Prison

D                                G
Well, he’s not very handsome to look at
D                              A
He’s shaggy and he eats like a hog
D                              G
And he’s always out killin’ my chickens,
D              A           G          
That dirty old egg sucking dog.

G      
Egg sucking dog, 
          D                      A
I’m gonna stomp your head in the ground.
       D                    G    
If you don’t stay out of my hen house.
    D          A          D
You dirty old egg sucking hound.

D                              G
Now if he don’t stop eating my eggs up, 
       D                  A
Though I’m not a real bad guy,
    D                       G
I’m gonna take my rifle and send him 
        D           A           G
To that big chicken coop in the sky. 


G      
Egg sucking dog, 
          D                      A
I’m gonna stomp your head in the ground.
       D                    G    
If you don’t stay out of my hen house.
    D          A          D
You dirty old egg sucking hound.


Just a good old fun song, which should be played and sung for just that reason. 

-- Jersey Joe
