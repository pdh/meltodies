      music by Bob Dylan


CAPO: 2ND FRET



G          F           C           G
I married Isis on the fifth day of May

G                    F         C     G
But I could not hold on to her very long

G               F           C            G
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away

G                    F              C            G
For the wild unkown country where I could not go wrong
