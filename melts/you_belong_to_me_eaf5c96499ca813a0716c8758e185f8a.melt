by Bob Dylan

   C                 Em
1. See the pyramids along the Nile
   F                        C
   Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle
   F                     Em      Am
   Just remember darling all the while
   Dm            G
   You belong to me
   C                       Em
2. See the market place in old Algiers
   F                        C
   Send me photographes and souvenirs
   F                     Em       Am
   Just remember when a dream appears
   Dm            G
   You belong to me
   C                   F
B: I'd be so alone without you
   Dm                      G
   Maybe you'd be lonesome too
       G7
   in blue
   C                  Em
3. Fly the ocean in a silver plane=7F
   F                        C
   See the jungle when it's wet with rain
   F                         Em     Am
   Just remember till you're home again
   Dm            G
   You belong to me

INTRO

   C                   F
B: I'd be so alone without you
   Dm                      G
   Maybe you'd be lonesome too

   C                  Em
3. Fly the ocean in a silver plane
   F                        C
   See the jungle when it's wet with rain
   F                         Em     Am
   Just remember till you're home again
   Dm            G
   You belong to me
