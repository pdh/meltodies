The Nearest thing to heaven
Johnny Cash
By Marcel Veltman


        C
I have sailed the piecefull waters of the ocean wide and blue
   G                                      C
I held my breath and watched the western sunset's golden view

I've flown above the mountainpeaks and valley's wide and green
                G                G7               C
But you're the nearest thing to heaven That I've seen

              F                                C
  You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
        G                                  C
  I've searched for happiness so long and far
           F
  But my search for love was through
       C
  The day that I found you
                    G                G7              C
  Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are

I confess that I've been tempted by the luring magic charms
When a smile was flashed my way and stood before to open marks
But I turned and walked away because I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven, darling you

(Chorus)

I have watched the silver raindrops fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds had blown away
I love the pretty flowers but I cannot buy their worth
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth

(Chorus)
