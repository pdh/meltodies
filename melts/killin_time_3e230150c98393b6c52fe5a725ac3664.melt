Verse 1  : 

A                        D/A
   People polishing guns

A                                D/A
 They've got nothing better to do

A                                      D/A
  Though they think they're having fun

A                           E           A
They're just living to die, if they but knew now, now

Waiting for the milk to come

A                           D/A
  Watch them turn into stone

A                                E            A
  Thinking 'bout the things they might have done now, now

 Everybody's got to know

  Love's the reason we're here

A                             D/A
