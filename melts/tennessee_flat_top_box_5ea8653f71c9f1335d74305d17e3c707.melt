Intro:

|     A     |     A     |     A     |     D     |
|     A     |     A     |     A     |

        A                                            E
In a little cabaret, in a south Texas border town,
                                                                                 A
Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around.
                                                E
And all the girls from there to Austin were slippin' 'way from home
                                   A                                             E
And puttin' jew'lry in hock to take the trip to go and listen
                                                                                                 A
To the little dark haired boy that played the Tennessee flat top box.
                        D
And he would play...


Guitar Solo:

|     D     |     D     |     D     |     A     |
|     A     |     A     |     A     |     D     |
|     D     |     D     |     D     |     A     |
|     A     |     A     |     A     |     D     |
|     A     |     A     |     A     |

               A                                                                       E
Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
                                                                   A
But give him his guitar and he'd be happy all the time.
                                              E
And all the girls from nine to ninety
                                                                                              A
Were snappin' fingers, tappin' toes and beggin' him, "Don't stop!"
                                             E
And hypnotized, and fasci - nated
                                                                                                 A
By the little dark haired boy that played the Tennessee flat top box.
                        D
And he would play...


Guitar Solo:

|     D     |     D     |     D     |     A     |
|     A     |     A     |     A     |     D     |
|     D     |     D     |     D     |     A     |
|     A     |     A     |     A     |     D     |
|     A     |     A     |     A     |

          A                                                        E
Then one day he was gone and no one ever saw him 'round.
                                                                                      A
He vanished like the breeze, and they forgot him in the little town.
                                                 E
But all the girls still dreamed a-bout him
                                                                               A
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
                                                  E
And then one day on the hit pa-rade
                                                                                                 A
Was a little dark haired boy that played the Tennessee flat top box.
                        D
And he would play...
