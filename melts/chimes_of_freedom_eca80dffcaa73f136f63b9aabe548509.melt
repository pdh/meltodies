The parts labeled "riff" in the chords are a little fancy transition between the D and G
and it goes like this:
Csus2  G6
E|-0-0-0--|
B|-3-3-3--|
G|-0-0-0--|
D|-0-0-0--|
A|-3-3-2--|
E|--------|Those are all eighth notes- the actual strumming pattern has more
notes in it, but that's easy enough to get on your own. Each chord lasts the duration of
eighth note.

G                     D           G                 C
Far between sundown's finish, and midnight's broken toll
   G                 C        D       G
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashin'
                     D            G              C
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
    G             D          riff   G
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashin'
D                               G
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
C                G               Am              D
Flashing for the refugees in the unarmed road of flight
        G              D        G              C
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
       G              C         D       G         GC D G
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

                     D             G          C
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
      G           D      riff       G           D
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
       G           D             G                  C
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
G                  D     riff   G
Dissolved into the bells of the lighting
D                      G
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
C               G             Am            D
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked
G               D        G                     C
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
       G              C         D       G        
riff G
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'


[The rest of the song follows the pattern of the second verse.]

Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
An' the unpawned painter behind his rightful time
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
