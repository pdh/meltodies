		Lie lie lie lie la


		Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
		Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
		Leading me, going home.

		In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
		And he carries a reminder ov ev'ry glove that laid him down
		Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
		I am leaving, I am leaving
		But the fighter still remains

		Lie la lie ... etc.

The Boxer
by Paul Simon         from the Album "Bridge Over Troubled Waters"

C                                                Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
           G
I have squandered my resistance
                      C
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
             Am            G                  F
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
                    C      G    C
And disregards the rest
                                                     Am
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
         G
In the company of strangers
        Dm7        C
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
       Am           G                F
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
         G              F    Em   Dm    C
Looking for the places only they would know
        Am
Lie-la-lie
        G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
        Am
Lie la lie
G                       F           G   C
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie
                                                 Am
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
                G
But I get no offers
         Dm7              C
Just a come-on from the whores on seventh avenue
        Am                 Dm7     G     F                                 C
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there
        G               C
Ooo-la-la la la la la

        Am
Lie-la-lie
        G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
        Am
Lie la lie
G                       F           G   C
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie

C
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
G7  C              Am
And wishing I was gone
       G             Dm7      G7               G  C
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
            Am
Leading me
        G
Going Home
       C                                            Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
          G
And he carries the reminders
    G7               C                        Dm7     G7        C
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him 'till he cried out
                        Am
In his anger and his shame
        G              F                              C
"I am Leaving, I am Leaving."  But the Fighter still remains

G C  G      F      C

        Am
Lie-la-lie
        G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
        Am
Lie la lie
 G                        F             Am
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie
