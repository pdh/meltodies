Intro: 
F



                    D# Bb                 F
It's a cheating situa-tion A stealing invitation
                   C
To take what's not really ours
                       Bb       F
To make it through the midnight hours
                    D# Bb                  F 
It's a cheating situa-tion Just a cheap imitation
              C                                  F
Doing what we have to do When there's no love at home


                     C
There's no use in pretending 
                    F  
There'll be a happy ending
          C
Where our love's concerned 
                    F
Sweetheart, we both know
                         C
We'll take love where we find it
                Bb   F
Love and try to hide it
     C
It's all we got

For we know they're not
      Bb     F
Gonna let us go


                    D# Bb                 F
It's a cheating situa-tion A stealing invitation
                   C
To take what's not really ours
                       Bb       F
To make it through the midnight hours
                    D# Bb                  F 
It's a cheating situa-tion Just a cheap imitation
              C                                  F
Doing what we have to do When there's no love at home

                   D# Bb
It's a cheating situ-ation 
C                       F
When there's no love at home
