                 Intro/Solo part
 G
Where did all the feelings go?
Bm
What about that happy glow?
Cmaj7
Was that so long ago,
Am            C
When we were first in love?

G  
I didn't feel the change,
Bm
Everything was still the same.
Cmaj7
And when that moment came,
Am            Em
I didn't know.

I miss the feeling,
I miss the light,
But I got faith in something,
I'll never give up the fight.

Why's it so heavy,
This love of mine?
I lost the feeling,
I lost the time.

G                      Bm        Cmaj7
I'd like to shake your hand, Disappointment
Am             C     G             Bm                Cmaj7   Am Em
Looks like you win again, but this time might be the last.


Let's say I got a habit
Let's say it's hard to break
Let's say we got to do something
Before it's just too late.

I want to get you back
I don't know how to do that
I miss you loving me
The way you used to.

I'm taking the blame myself
For livin' my life in a shell
And now I'm breakin' out
But will you still be there.

Let's say that love is blind
Let's say that time is kind
Let's say that it's not over
'Til it's over.

I'd like to shake your hand, Disappointment
Looks like you win again, but this time might be the last.
