performed by Waylon Jennings.


Verse 1:
         E             F#m          A           E
	Come here and look through the window Marie
                      F#m         A            E
	Open up the shutters,tell me what you see
          G#m                       A           E
	Was that his knock that i heard at the door
                      F#m            D             E
	Or is it six white horses coming down the road


Verse 2:
         E             F#m          A               E
	Come here and touch me and say that it's alright
                       F#m            A                E
	You know that to my eyes the days are as the nights
          G#m                        A                  E
	Read again the letter that tells me where he's gone
                         F#m         D           E
	To hell with the fighting i want my son home


Verse 3:
          E              F#m             A             E
	I taught him to fish and i taught him to be strong
                         F#m           A        E
	I taught him that killing any man was wrong
           G#m                       A                E
	But tommorrow in battle i'd run to where he stood
                         F#m         D           E
	If the help of a blind man would do any good


Break (F#).


Verse 4:(a tone higher)
           F#          G#m        B          F#
	Last night i went to his room for awhile
                          G#m               B           F#
	I've touched all the things that he used as a child
           A#m                    B          F#
	I rocked the cradle where he used to lay
                          G#m         E         F#
	I found his tin soldiers and threw them away


Verse 5:(idem)
           F#           G#m         B          F#
	Come here and look through the window Marie
                      G#m          B          F#
	Open up the shutters,tell me what you see
           A#m                  B               F#
	Was that his knock that i heard at the door
                      G#m            E          F#
	Or is it six white horses coming up the road


You can play G#m (and the others same way):  ||||||
                                             ||||||
                                             ||||||
                                             xxxxxx
                                             ||||||
