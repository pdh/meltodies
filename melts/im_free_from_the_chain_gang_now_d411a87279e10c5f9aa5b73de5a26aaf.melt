Capo 1st Fret

The pull-on-offy stuff is fairly intuitive, basically it centers around  the top two
and involves a pull off on the B string: 0-1-3  between the G and C chords, and that same
reverse a hammer on: 0-1-3, before you play the G chord.  Listen to it and you'll get 
feel of it.  The actual chord figuring out was the tricky part for me and I am not sure
the G/C or the G/Dish chord that I transcribed, but it works.

       G            C             G
I got rid of the shackles that bound me
         G                G/C      D
and the guards that were always around me
       G            C             G
There were tears on the mail mother wrote me in jail
       G               G/Dish     G
But I'm free from the chain gang now

       G            C             G
All the years I was known and respected
         G                G/C      D
'til one day I was wrongly suspected
       G            C             G
I was shackled in chains in a cold freezin' rain
       G               G/Dish     G
but I'm free from the chain gang now


[Guitar]

       G            C             G
All the years I was known by a number
      G         G/C      D
how I kept my mind is a wonder
       G            C             G
But like a bird in a tree I got my liberty
       G               G/Dish     G
and I'm free from the chain gang now

       G            C             G
I got rid of the shackles that bound me
         G                G/C      D
and the guards that were always around me

            G            C             G
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail
       G               G/Dish     G
But I'm free from the chain gang now

            G            C             G
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail
       G               G/Dish     G
But I'm free from the chain gang now
