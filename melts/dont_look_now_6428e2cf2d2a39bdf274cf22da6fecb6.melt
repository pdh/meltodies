E                 A             E
Who will take the coal from the mine?

Who will take the salt from the earth? 
A                      E
Who ll take a leaf and grow it to a tree? 
A               B7              E
Don t look now, it ain t you or me.

E                 A               E
Who will work the fields with his hands? 
                 A           E
Who will put his back to the plough? 
A                            E        
Who ll take the mountain and give it to the sea? 
A               B7              E
Don t look now, it ain t you or me.

Don t look now, it ain t you or me.
