         C                        C7              F         D
    It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,
           C         G              C      - G
    oh, I'm my own grandpa !
 
      C         G             C   F         Dm           G
    I'm my own grandpa, I'm my own grandpa !
                     C            C7             F          D
    It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,
           C          G             C
    oh, I'm my own grandpa !
 
              C                                          G
1. Now many, many years ago, when I was twenty-three,
                                   G7                       C
    I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be.
                                   C7                                Dm
    This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red,
           D                D7                           G                           G7
    my father fell in love with her, and soon the two were wed.
 
              C                                                    G
2. This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life,
                                        G7                          C
    my daughter was my mother, cause she was my father's wife.
                                    C7                 Dm
    To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy,
         D                       D7               G                    G7
    I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.
 
           C                                        G
3. My little baby then became a brother-in-law to Dad,
                                    G7                       C
    and so became my uncle, though it made me very sad.
                                C7             Dm
    For if he was my uncle, that also made him brother
              D                           D7                        G                     G7
  of the widow's grown-up daughter, who, of course, was my stepmother.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          C                                                   G
4. My father's wife then had a son who kept him on the run,
                                      G7                       C
    and he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son.
                                    C7                      Dm
    My wife is now my mother's mother, and it makes me blue,
           D                       D7                    G                 G7
    because she is my wife, she's my grandmother, too.
 
             C                                               G
5. Now if my wife is my grandmother, then I'm her grandchild,
                                G7               C
    and everytime I think of it, it nearly drives me wild.
                                  C7                           Dm
    For now I have become the strangest case you ever saw,
           D                      D7                   G                        G7
    as husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpa !
 
      C         G             C   F         Dm           G
    I'm my own grandpa, I'm my own grandpa !
                     C            C7             F          D
    It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,
           C          G             C
    oh, I'm my own grandpa !
 I’m my own grandpa       (Listen to midi)
 
         C                        C7              F         D
    It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,
           C         G              C      - G
    oh, I'm my own grandpa !
 
      C         G             C   F         Dm           G
    I'm my own grandpa, I'm my own grandpa !
                     C            C7             F          D
    It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,

    my father fell in love with her, and soon the two were wed.
 
              C                                                    G
