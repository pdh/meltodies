                                 Unwed Fathers
                                 by John Prine

          G                  C         G       C
          In an Appalachian, Greyhound station
                         G        D           G
          She sits there waiting, in a family way
                            C          G         C
          'Goodbye brother, Tell Mom I love her'
                        G       D              G
          'Tell all the others, I'll write someday'

          Chorus:
          G               C                  G
          From an teenage lover, to an unwed mother
                                          D
          kept undercovers, like some bad dream
                      G        C             G        C
          While unwed fathers, they can't be bothered
                        G      D                  G
          They run like water, through a mountain stream

          G                        C             G          C
          In a cold and grey town, a nurse say's 'Lay down'
                         G            D             G
          'This ain't no playground, and this ain't home'
                             C          G       C
          Someones children, out having children
                          G          D     G
          in a grey stone building, all al-one
          (Chorus)

          G                      C               G         C
          Some where else bound, Smokey Mountain Greyhound
                       G          D            G
          She bows her head down, humming lullabys
                             C                 G     C
          'Your daddy never, meant to hurt you ever'
                         G          D                 G
          'he just don't live here, but you've got his eyes'
          (Chorus)
