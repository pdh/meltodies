Born To Love You
Recorded by Waylon Jennings (Circa 1967)
Written by Woody Starr

Key of G, no capo needed to play with the youtube video.


 
G            C    G
Born to love only you
            D7                G
Destined to die alone without you
                  C              G
Knowing my dreams can never come true
                 D7                 G
Yet knowing that I was born to love you



C           G     D7          G
Night after night longing for you
C        G    A7           D7
Living a lie  built around you
G                 C              G
Knowing my dreams can never come true
                 D7                 G
Yet knowing that I was born to love you



Instrumental (mostly lead guitar) ...very short.


                  C              G
Knowing my dreams can never come true
                 D7                 G
Yet knowing that I was born to love you
