DEAR ABBY by John Prine
this version works but version 3 is CORRECT
C                          F            C
Dear Abby, Dear Abby, my feet are too long
C                            D              G
My hair's falling out and my rights are all wrong
C                                    F             C
My friends they all tell me, they're no friends at all
C                                      F         C
Won't you write me a letter, won't you give me a call
G  F     C
Signed Bewildered


CHORUS:
C                          F       C
Bewildered, Bewildered you have no complaint
C                            D             G
You are what you are and you ain't what you ain't
C                    F       C
So listen up buster listen up good
C                               F        C 
Stop wishin' for bad luck and knockin' on wood
G   F       C
SIGNED Dear Abby



C                         F           C
Dear Abby, Dear Abby, my fountain pen leaks
C                            D           G
My wife hollers at me and my kids are all freaks
C                               F           C
Every side I get up on is the wrong side of bed
C                               F          C
If it weren't so expensive I'd wish I were dead
G    F    C
Signed Unhappy

CHORUS: (unhappy)

C                          F           C
Dear Abby, Dear Abby, you won't believe this
C                             D                G
But my stomache makes noises whenever I kiss
C                            F         C
My girlfriend tells me it's all in my head
C                           F         C
But my stomache tells me to write you instead
G    F    C
Signed Noisemaker.

CHORUS: (noisemaker)

C                             F              C
Dear Abby, Dear Abby, well I never thought
C                               D        G
That me and my girlfriend would ever get caught
C                                       F          C
We were sittin' in the back seat just shootin' the breeze
C                                    F          C
With her hair up in curlers and her pants to her knees
G    F      C
Signed Just Married


CHORUS: (just Married)
