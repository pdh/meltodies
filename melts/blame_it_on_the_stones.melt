Dm            C               Dm     C    Dm
Mister Marvin Middle Class is really in a stew
Dm                 C           Dm        C     Dm
Wond'rin' what the younger generation's coming to
        F               C            Dm                Am
And the taste of his martini doesn't please his bitter tongue (Extremely Simple Riff)
Dm       C              Dm
Blame it on the Rolling Stones.

(Pre-chorus chord change - C)

F                       Bb
Blame it on the Stones; blame it on the Stones
F                                   G               C
You'll feel so much better, knowing you don't stand alone
F                    Bb
Join the accusation; save the bleeding nation
F                          G        C       F
Get it off your shoulders; blame it on the Stones

(Pre-verse chord change - Em)

The rest of the song is played likewise.




Mother tells the ladies at the bridge club every day
Of the rising price of tranquilizers she must pay
And she wonders why the children never seem to stay at home (Extremely Simple Riff)
Blame it on the Rolling Stones.

Blame it on the Stones; Blame it on the Stones
You'll feel so much better, knowing you don't stand alone
Join the accusation; save the bleeding nation
Get it off your shoulders; blame it on the Stones

Father's at the office, nightly working all the time
Trying to make the secretary change her little mind
And it bothers him to read about so many broken homes (Extremely Simple Riff)
Blame it on those Rolling Stones.

Blame it on the Stones; Blame it on the Stones
You'll feel so much better knowing you don't stand alone
Join the accusation; same the bleeding nation
Get it off your shoulders; blame it on the Stones

Blame it on the stones, blame it on the stones.
