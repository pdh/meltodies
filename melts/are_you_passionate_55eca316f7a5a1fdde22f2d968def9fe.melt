Verse:
        Cmaj7       Am
Are you passionate?
        G/B             D
Are you livin' like you talk?
        Cmaj7        Am
Are you dreamin' how
            G/B          D
That you're goin' to the top?

        Cmaj7     Am
Are you negative?
     G/B   D/A  Cmaj7/G D/F# C      D
In a world that    ne - ver  stops
           C    D
Turnin' on you

Turnin' on me
           E
Turnin' on you.
Verse:
        Cmaj7       Am
Are you loving it?
        G/B             D
Can you ever get enough of it?
        Cmaj7        Am
Is it everything?
     G/B   D/A  Cmaj7/G D/F# C      D
A love that never stops,
           C    D
Comin' to you
           C    D
Comin' to me
           E
Comin' to you.

Chorus:
Am           B
Once I was a soldier
      Em               A
I was fighting in the sky
        Am           D              E
And the gunfire kept comin' back on me.
     Am            D
So I dove into the darkness
      G               C
And I let my missiles fly
    Am                D
And they might be the ones
              E
That kept you free.

Chorus:
Am           B
Once I was a prisoner
      Em               A
I was riding in a truck
        Am           D              E
Cleaned up for a public display.
     Am            D
I looked at those around me
      G               C
And when they looked at me
    Am                D        E
I let them see my soul on that day.
Verse:
        Cmaj7       Am
Are you scared of it?
        G/B             D
Do you wish that it would stop?
        Cmaj7        Am
Does it bother you
            G/B          D
When you hear your spirit talk?

        Cmaj7       Am
Well I'm right with you
     G/B   D/A  Cmaj7/G D/F# C      D
Yes I'm right with you
           C    D
It's working on me
           C    D
It's working on you
           E
It's working on me.
