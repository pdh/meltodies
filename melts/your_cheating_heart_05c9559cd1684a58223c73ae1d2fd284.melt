Tuning: Standard.

I looked all over for the chords for this song and couldn't find them, so I decided to
just figure it out for myself. I'm pretty sure it's all correct, it sounds right to me.


                      G                         C
Your cheating heart will make you weep

                     D                 G
You'll cry and cry, and try to sleep

                        G                     C
But sleep won't come the whole night through

                      D                  G 
Your cheating heart will tell on you

                           C                    G
When tears come down like falling rain

                 A                      D
You'll toss around and call my name

                       G                    C
You'll walk the floor the way I do

                      D                       G
Your cheating heart will tell on you

                     C                          G
When tears come down like falling rain

                A                       D
You'll toss around and call my name

                                   G                           C
You're gonna walk the floor the very way I do

                      D      -
Your cheating heart - is gonna tell on you
