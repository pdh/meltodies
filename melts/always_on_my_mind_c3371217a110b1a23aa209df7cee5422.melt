You Were Always On My Mind
recorded by Willie Nelson
written by Wayne C. Thompson and Johnny Christopher

G              D7
Maybe I didn't love you
Em       G          C
Quite as often as I could have
G              D7
Maybe I didn't treat you
Em       G         A7
Quite as good as I should have
 
C                  G
If I made you feel second best
C        G           Am
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
D7       G      D7    G
You were always on my mind
D7       C      D7    G
You were always on my mind
 
                   D7
And maybe I didn't hold you
Em        G             C
All those lonely lonely times
G               D7
I guess I never told you
Em     G               A7
I'm so happy that your mine
 
C                           G
Little things I should have said and done
C      G              Am   D7
I just never took the time
         G      D7    G
You were always on my mind
D7       C      D7    G
You were always on my mind
  
      Em     C
Tell  me     tell me 
          G                 Am
That your sweet love hasn't died
G    Em     G       C
Give me     give me one more chance
   G             Am
To keep you satisfied
     D7            G
I'll keep you satisfied
  
C                           G
Little things I should have said and done
       G              Am   D7
I just never took the time
         G      D7    G
You were always on my mind
D7       C      D7    G
You were always on my mind
