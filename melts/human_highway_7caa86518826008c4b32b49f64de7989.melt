Human Highway by Neil Young

       G   C               G       Em
I come down from the misty mountain

      D   C             G      C/G G
I got lost on the human highway

        G   C           G       Em
Take my head refreshing fountain

        D   C                  G     C/G G
Take my eyes from what they've seen.

        C                  D Dsus4 D
Take my head and change my mind

Gmaj7                C
How could people get so unkind.

Dadd2add4 (see tab)  G  C/G G


I come down from the crooked mansion
I went lookin' for the D.J.'s daughter
Since that day I heard it mentioned
That my name is on the line.
Now, my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind.

I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they've seen.
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind.
