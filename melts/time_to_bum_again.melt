Time To Bum Again
-Waylon Jennings


G		     C
Woman you get meaner every day
	  D		    G
and your naggin is hard to stand
				C
So I'll pack my things and I'll be on my way
	  D	      G	
cause its time to bum again



G			     C	
This house gets smaller with every day
	D		 G
And the walls are closin in
			      C
Ive guess I've said all there is to say
	D	    G
and its time to bum again.



CHORUS:

G		     C
The time has come to bum again
	 D
Im gonna see all the places
G
I aint been
			   C
Woman youve stirred up the wild wild wind
	D	    G
and its time to bum again




A			   D
I'll visit my buddy out in Bakerfield,
   E			    A
We soldiered together years back
				    D
Well talk night and day till theres no more to say
   	  E		   A
then I'll head on down the track
		     D
I may come back in a year or two
	E		  A
And you may not desire me then
			     D
There are some things that a man must do
	E	    A
And its time to bum again.



A		     D
The time has come to bum again
	 E		    A
Im gonna see all the places I aint been
			    D
woman you've stirred up the wild, wild, wind
	E	    A
and its time to bum again
			    D
woman you've stirred up the wild, wild, wind 
	E	    A
and its time to bum again.
