A White Sport Coat (and a pink carnation) 
written and recorded by Marty Robbins

   C                        F       G7
   A white sport coat and a pink carnation
      F            G7         C     G7
   I'm all dressed up for the dance
     C                      F       G7
   A white sport coat and a pink carnation
   F       G7       C
   I'm all alone in romance
 
   G7
   Once you told me long ago
   C
   To the prom with me you'd go
   D7
   Now you've changed your mind it seems
   G7
   Someone else will hold my dreams
 
   C                         F       G7
   A white sports coat and a pink carnation
   F        G7       C
   I'm in a blue blue mood
