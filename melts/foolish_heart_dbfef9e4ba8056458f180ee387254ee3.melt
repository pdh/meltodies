							Foolish Heart

	I suppose it may be a little too early to be iconizing this song
by posting the chords 'n' lyrix, but here they are to "Foolish Heart". 
As usual, chords that I don't know the names to I've either hazarded a
guess or assigned Roman numerals to.  If there is a conflict between one
of the names chosen for the more abstruse chords in the song and the
diagrams rendered, by all means go with the diagrams.  And as always, if
there are any corrections or questions (especially if you know the names
to some of these weirdoes [sp?]) PLEASE let me know.  
	Also, a big thank you to whoever posted Cats Under the Stars. 8*D

   C#9(?)	 F#7aug3rd	 E7aug3rd	    VI (some variant of Bmin)

Other than the chords in the above diagrams, all chords are regular bar
chords, except for Gmaj7 and D at "unto a foolish heart" and the E7 at
the instrumental part, which are regular open chords at the low end of
the neck.  Most of the action takes place above the fifth fret, one
notable exception being that the Bmin at "never give your love..." is
with the bar on the second fret, allowing easy passage into the VI
chord.  Go nuts.
