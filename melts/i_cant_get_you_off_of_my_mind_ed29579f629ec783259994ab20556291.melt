     D
Oh I can't get you off of my mind
                               A
When I try I 'm just wastin my time
         D             
Lord Ive tried and Ive tried
    G                    D
and all night long Ive cried
                    A         D
But I can't get you off of my mind.




Chorus:
D
Didn't think you would leave me behind
                                  A
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
       D                        G                  D
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart
                     A         D
When I can't get you off of my mind.





    D
You believe that a true love is blind
                               A
So you fool every new love you find
          D                           G              D
Youve got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies
                    A      D
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.



(Repeat Chorus)
