D#    Bb




Bb         D#                        Bb
You and me sittin' in the back of my memory
Bb               D#                      Bb
Like a honey bee Buzzin round a glass of sweet Chablis
F          D#                       Bb
Radio's on Windows rolled up And my mind's rolled down
F                       D#                  Bb
Headlights shining Like silver moons Rollin on the ground


Bb              D#       Bb   
We made love in everyway love can be made
Bb               D#                   Bb    
And we made time look like time Could never fade
F               D#            Bb
Friday Night We both made the guitar hum
F             D#                        F
Saturday made Sunday feel Like it would never come


           Bb
Gonna be a long Monday
Bb
Sittin' all alone on a mountain
Bb
By a river that has no end
Bb
Gonna be a long Monday
F
Stuck like the tick of a clock
              D#     Bb
That's come unwound again


Break:
Bb    F  D#  Bb



Bb           D#                 Bb
Soul to soul heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Bb           D#                     Bb
Come on baby give me a kiss that'll last all week
F                  D#            Bb
The thought of you leavin' again Brings me down
F              D#                     F
The promise of Your sweet love Brings me around



(Repeat Chorus)



Break:
Bb    F  D#  Bb
