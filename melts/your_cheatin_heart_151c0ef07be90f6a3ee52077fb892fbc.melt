Your Cheatin Heart - Hank Williams

Alternating bass notes

Intro:
G7 C

Verse 1:
              C                   F
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
               G                C
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
                C                     F
But sleep won't come the whole night through
               G                 C
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you


Chorus:
                F                 C
When tears come down like fallin' rain
              D7                G
You'll toss around and call my name
                   C            F
You'll walk the floor the way I do
               G7                C
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you


Interlude:
C F G (x2)


Verse 2:
              C                    F
Your cheatin' heart will pine some day
              G                C
And crave the love you threw away
              C                   F 
The time will come when you'll be blue
              G                 C
Your cheatin heart will tell on you

Repeat Chorus
