Johnny Cash - Guess Things Happen That Way  

       A                                D        
Well, you ask me if I'll forget my baby
A                        D
I guess I will    some day
A                                 E                                          A  (E)
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way


    A                          D      
You ask me if I'll get along
A                          D
I guess I will    some way
A                                  E                                            A  (E)
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

Chorus:
D                              A                            E                             A        
God gave me that girl to lean on,   then he put me on my own
D                            A                        E                                     A
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone
A                                 E                                             A  (E)
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

  
       A                    D          
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
A                       D
I guess I will   every day
A                                E                                               A  (E)
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way


         A                     D          
You ask me if I'll find another
A                      D
I don't know, I can't say
A                                E                                              A  (E)
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

Chorus
