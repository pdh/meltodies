TUMBLING DICE- The Rolling Stones

TUNING: D A D F# A D

   D
Women think I'm tasty but they're always tryin' to waste me

And make me burn the candle right down
    B  D  B  D   A                             B
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown

Cos all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin like I don't know how
But baby, baby, there's fever in the funkhouse now

This low down bitchin' got my poor feet aitchin'
You know, you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, I can't stay
            A
You got to roll me       
      B                   D
And call me the tumbling dice

Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Do you see the time flashing by
Honey, got no money, I'm all sixes, sevens and nines

Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
But baby, I can't stay
             A           B
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling
 A           B                     D
Roll me and call me the tumbling dice
           
Oh my my my, I'm the lone crap shooter 
Playin' in the field every night
Baby, can't stay
              A          B
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling
  A          B                     D
Roll me and call me the tumbling dice
         A  D
Got to roll me
         A  D      
Got to roll me ...
