Verse:
D                 Em                 A
Everyone is trying to get to the bar
                 G                      D
The name of the bar, the bar is called heaven
                           Em             A
The band in heaven plays my favorite song
                        G                        D
They play it once again, they play it all night long

Chorus:
Bm            Am         C            G
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens
Bm            Am         C            G
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens

Verse:

There is a party, everyone is there
Everyone will leave at exactly the same time
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun

Repeat Chorus:

Verse:

When this kiss is over it will start again
It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
could be so exciting, could be so much fun

Repeat Chorus:
