 Drive On

 E                               E7
 I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
           A                                
 He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam
    B7                                        
 He said is my country just a little off track
          E                    B7               E
 Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back  
           E                                   E7
 But, it's better than not coming back at all  
 A                         
 Many a good man I saw fall
 B7                              
 And even now, every time I dream
            E                          B7             E
 I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream  

|        E                      
|Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
|        B7                     E               
|My children love me , but they don't understand
|    A                 E            
|And I got a woman who knows her man
|                              B7    E 
|Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on

 I remember one night, Tex and me
 Rappelled in on a hot L.Z.
 We had our 16's on rock and roll
 But, with all that fire, I was scared and cold
 We were crazy, we were wild
 And I have seen the tiger smile
 I spit in a bamboo viper's face
 And I'd be dead , but by God's grace

 {chorus}

 It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain
 And nobody tried to be John Wayne
 I came home, but Tex did not
 And I can't talk about the hit he got
 I got a little limp now when I walk
 Got a little tremolo when I talk
 But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
 You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam

 {chorus}
