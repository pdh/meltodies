Fm (8th Fret)      Bbm (6th Fret)          C Major (8th Fret)

Fm
I know you've been hurt by someone else
      Bbm                           Fm
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
                                    C
But if you let me, here's what I'll do
                  Fm
I'll take care of you

Fm
I've loved and I lost the same as you
             Bbm                        Fm
So you see I know just what you've been through
                                    C
And if you let me, here's what I'll do
                  Fm
I'll take care of you

Fm                        Bbm
You won't ever have to worry
                        Fm
You won't ever have to whine
                         Bbm
For I'll be there beside you
                    C
To dry your weeping eye

Fm
So darling tell me that you'll be true
           Bbm                                     Fm
There's no doubt in my mind, I know what I want to do
                                        C
And then just as sure as one and one is two
                         Fm
I know I'll take care of you


Fm
I'll take care of you

I'll take care of you

I'll take care of you
