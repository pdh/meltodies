All the other tabs sound off key to the recorded version. And the part of the song
that goes “It goes like this the fourth the fifth” is telling you the actual
progression. G is the fifth in C!!! Not E!!

HALLELUJAH - Leonard Cohen
	
  C                 (C/B)    Am	 
I heard there was a secret chord      
     C                (C/B)        Am
that David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                 G                C  G 
But you don't really care for music do ya
     C		          F		G
It goes like this the fourth the fifth
     Am		          F
the minor fall and the major lift
       G             E7           Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah
     F	        Am	   F	           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
    

     F	        Am	      F	           C G 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
     F	        Am	      F	           C G 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
     F	        Am	      F	           C G 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
     F	        Am	      F	           C G C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
