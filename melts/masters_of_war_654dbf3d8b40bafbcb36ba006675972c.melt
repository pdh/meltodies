A couple of submitters over the internet were submitting this song incorrectly, so I had 
to submit the correct way to play this song. It's from Bob Dylan's 1963 album ''The Freewheelin'
Bob Dylan''.


Capo on the 8th fret:

Intro | Am *G/A |


Am                G/A Am G/A
Come you masters of war
Am                  G/A  Am G/A
You that build all the guns
Am                  G/A    Am   G/A
You that build the death planes
Am                  G/A  Am  G/A
You that build the big bombs
Am                G/A  Am  G/A
You that hide behind walls
Am                G/A   Am  G/A
You that hide behind desks
Am                  G
I just want you to know
                       Am    G/A
I can see through your masks


Am              G/A   Am    G/A
You that never done nothin’
Am            G/A  Am  G/A
But build to destroy
Am             G/A  Am  G/A
You play with my world
Am             G/A     Am  G/A
Like it’s your little toy
Am              G/A   Am  G/A
You put a gun in my hand
Am                G/A  Am G/A
And you hide from my eyes
Am                    G
And you turn and run farther
                       Am    G/A
When the fast bullets fly

Am         G/A  Am  G/A
Like Judas of old
Am        G/A   Am  G/A
You lie and deceive
Am              G/A  Am  G/A
A world war can be won
Am          G/A   Am   G/A
You want me to believe
Am                 G/A   Am  G/A
But I see through your eyes
Am                G/A   Am   G/A
And I see through your brain
Am                     C
Like I see through the water
      G             Am    G/A    Am   G/A
That runs down my drain


Am       G/A    Am      G/A
You fasten the triggers
Am            G/A   Am   G/A
For the others to fire
Am             G/B     Am    G/A
Then you set back and watch
Am        G            Am    G/A
When the death count gets higher
Am             G/A    Am   G/A
You hide in your mansion
Am     G      G/B    Am   G/A
As young people’s blood
Am                   G
Flows out of their bodies
                      Am   G/A
And is buried in the mud


Am                G/A   Am    G/A
You’ve thrown the worst fear
Am             G/A   Am   G/A
That can ever be hurled
Am       G/A   Am      G/A   Am
Fear to bring children
G     D/F#  Am  G/A
Into the world
Am              G/A  Am   G/A
For threatening my baby
Am  G      D/F# Am  G/A
Unborn and unnamed
Am                   C
You ain’t worth the blood
      G            Am   G/A
That runs in your veins


Am           G/A Am   G/A
How much do I know
Am      G/A    Am   G/A
To talk out of turn
Am                   G/A  Am   G/A
You might say that I’m young
Am          G     D/F#  Am  G/A
You might say I’m unlearned
Am               G/A    Am   G/A
But there’s one thing I know
Am          G            Am   G/A
Though I’m younger than you
Am                 G
Even Jesus would never
D/F#              Am   G/A
Forgive what you do


Am              G/A  Am    G/A
Let me ask you one question
Am             G/A    Am   G/A
Is your money that good
Am                 G/A  Am G/A
Will it buy you forgiveness
Am        G        D/F# Am  G/A
Do you think that it could
Am          G/A   Am   G/A
I think you will find
Am         G           D/F# Am  G/A
When your death takes its toll
Am                G
All the money you made
            D/F#           Am   G/A
Will never buy back your soul

Am              G/A  Am   G/A
And I hope that you die
Am                G/A    Am G/A
And your death’ll come soon
Am             G/A    Am   G/A
I will follow your casket
Am    G        D/F# Am  G/A
In the pale afternoon
Am                    G/A     Am    G/A
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
Am             D/F# Am  G/A
Down to your deathbed
Am                         C
And I’ll stand o’er your grave
           G               Am
’Til I’m sure that you’re dead

That's it.
