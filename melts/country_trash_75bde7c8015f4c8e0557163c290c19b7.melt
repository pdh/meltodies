Hello! This is the most accurate version of this song I have found on here. Enjoy!

Capo on 2nd fret


         A           A           D        D
I got a crib full of corn, and a turnin’ plow
        E          E             A     A
But the grounds to wet for the hopper now.
       A       A        D       D
Got a cultivator and a double tree
     E      E           A       A 
A leather line for the HAW and gee
    A            A            D         D
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
     E       E         A        A
I’m doing alright for Country Trash

I’m saving up dimes for a rainy day
I got about a dollar laid away
The winds from the south and the fishings good
Got a pot belly stove and a CORD of wood
Mama turns the left-overs into hash 
I’m doing alright for Country Trash

I got a MACKINAW and a hunting dog
A cap I ordered from the catalogue
A big tall tree that shades the yard 
A big fat sow for the winters lard
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash 
I’m doing alright for
Country Trash

Well there’s not much new ground left to plow 
And the crops need fertilizer now 
My hands don’t earn me too much gold 
For security when I grow old 
But we’ll all be equal under the grass 
And God’s got a heaven for
Country Trash 
God’s got a heaven for
Country Trash 
I’ll be doing alright for
Country Trash
