Not Dark Yet chords
Bob Dylan 1997 (Time Out Of Mind album)

Capo IV

C C6 C 4x (C6, in this case = C chord with 4th finger on high E)

C                   F                    C  C6 C
Shadows are falling, and I been here all day
                     F                      C  C6 C
It's too hot to sleep, and time is running away
G            Am   F                C     C6 C
Feel like my soul, has turned into steel
Am                 C     F                    C   C6 C
I've still got the scars, that the sun didn't heal
G                Am         F          C    C6 C
There's not even room enough, to be anywhere
Am            C       F             C    C6 C 2x
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

C                         F                  C    C6 C
Well my sense of humanity, is going down the drain
                            F                           C   C6 C
Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain
G              Am     F                    C   C6 C 
She wrote me a letter, and she wrote it so kind
Am              C       F                C   C6 C
She put down in writin', what was in her mind
G            Am      F              C   C6 C
I just don't see why, I should even care
Am            C       F             C    C6 C 2x
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

C                    F                     C  C6 C
Well I been to London, and I been to gay Paree
                    F                  C  C6 C
I followed the river, and I got to the sea
G                     Am           F             C   C6 C
I've been down to the bottom, of a world full of lies
Am                 C       F            C   C6 C
I ain't lookin for nothin', in anyone's eyes
G            Am     F                   C   C6 C
Sometimes my burden, is more than I can bear
Am            C  F                  C    C6 C 2x 
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

C                                F            C   C6 C
I was born here and I'll die here, against my will
                              F                   C    C6 C
I know it looks like I'm movin', but I'm standin' still
Am                C    F                C   C6 C
Every nerve in my body, is so naked and numb
G              Am     F                                    C   C6 C
I can't even remember, what it was I came here to get away from
G                   Am    F      C     C6 C
Don't even hear the murmur, of a prayer
Am            C  F                  C    C6 C 2x 
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there
