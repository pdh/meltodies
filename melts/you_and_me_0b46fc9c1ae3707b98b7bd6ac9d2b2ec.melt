Dear FTP Server Operator,

This is an easier version of the song "You and Me" by
Neil Young.  I suggest it be called

  you_and_me.crd.easy

The part I want archived starts after the line of hyphens...
-------------------------------------------
For this song, I think bar chords are the way to go.
Don't be afraid to do some sliding during chord changes.
Most of the bar chords are just an A or and E configuration
moved to a different fret.  It's not hard to play once
you are comfortable with bar chords.

Here are how I play the chords:

E  779997
D  557775     I'm not a music theory expert by any stretch,
A  577655     so perhaps some of the strings that I indicated
C  335553     should be muted.  I don't know.
G  355433
Bm 224432
Am 577555

Neil Young does a bunch of funky plucking stuff that I
haven't taken the time to work out.  I'm not even sure if
the song is played in the key that I play it.

One more thing...  When you play the instrumental chord
progression, do Am and D the non-bar chord way.  You know
what I mean... Am 002210  D 000232

Lemme know if anyone figures it out further... tab perhaps.
