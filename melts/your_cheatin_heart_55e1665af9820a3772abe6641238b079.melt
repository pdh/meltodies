Verse 1:
              G                   C
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
               D              G
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
                G                    C
But sleep won't come the whole night through
              D                  G
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you


Chorus:
                C                 G
When tears come down like fallin' rain
              A7               D
You'll toss around and call my name
                G               C
You'll walk the floor the way I do
              D                  G
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you




Verse 2:
              G                    C
Your cheatin' heart will pine some day
              D               G
And crave the love you threw away
              G                   C 
The time will come when you'll be blue
             D                  G
Your cheatin heart will tell on you

Chorus:
                C                 G
When tears come down like fallin' rain
              A7               D
You'll toss around and call my name
                G               C
You'll walk the floor the way I do
              D                  G
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
