 Ev'rytime I hear the crack of a whip; my blood runs cold.
Bm7         Am7                Bm7                    Am7
 I remember on the slave ship, how they brutalise our very souls.
Bm7                  Am7          Bm7                    Am7
 Today they say that we are free;  only to be chained in poverty.
Bm7                        Am7       Bm7                       Am7
 Good God, I think it's il-literacy;  it's only a machine that makes money.
