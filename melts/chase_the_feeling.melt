INTRO: A

A
It takes one to know one baby, I know how you feel
A
You got your hunger and some problems that are real
           D
And you're dealin' with some demons who are drivin' you insane
      A
And I seen 'em drag you screamin' down the hallways of your brain


CHORUS:
             D
And you got loaded again
                               A
Ain't you handsome when you're high
           E
Oh nothin' matters
D                          A
Chase the feelin' 'til you die


Let it right on in there baby, let it run your life
Let it run your children off and let it run your wife
Let it take the joy you love and turn it to dispair
You know you knew better, baby, you just didn't care


CHORUS:
                D
'Cause you were loaded again
                               A
Ain't you handsome when you're high, you can't help it
           E
Oh nothin' matters
D                          A
Chase the feelin' 'til you die


SOLO: A  D  A  E D  A


Blame it on the moonlight, baby, think of number one
Tangled up in two when you were shinin' like the sun
With a pretty piece of hunger who was younger than her eyes
On the scale of cosmic thunder it's a wonder you're alive


CHORUS:
             D
And you were loaded again
                               A
Ain't you handsome when you're high
           E
Oh nothin' matters
D                          A
Chase the feelin' 'til you die


Let it right on in there baby, let it run your life
Let it run your children off and let it run your wife
Let it take the joy you love and turn it to dispair
You know you knew better, baby, you just didn't care

         D              A   E  D   A
You were loaded again
