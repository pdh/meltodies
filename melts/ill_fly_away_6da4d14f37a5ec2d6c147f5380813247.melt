 Bb                                        
Some glad morning when this life is o'er, 
Eb        Bb
I'll fly away; 
Bb
To a home on God's celestial shore, 
Bb/F  F   Bb       
I'll fly away

Chorus 

Bb
I'll fly away, Oh Glory 
Eb        Bb
I'll fly away; (in the morning) 
Bb     Gm       Bb/F          Gm/E
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by, 
Gm/Eb F   Bb
I'll fly away

When the shadows of this life have gone, 
I'll fly away; 
Like a bird from prison bars has flown, 
I'll fly away

Chorus 

Just a few more weary days and then, 
I'll fly away; 
To a land where joy shall never end, 
I'll fly away

Chorus
