The old Nashville cowboy


G                            D             G
The old Nashville cowboy was burdened with time
G                                Em             G
He was bent by his years and the fight with the wine
G                                C           G
With a head full of music and an old nursery rhyme
G                           D           G
A heart full of sadness and dark sunken eyes
G                             D            G
He told me they've cheated he told me they stole
G                                   Em             G
The strenght from his youth and the songs from his soul
G                            C          G
They said he was family till he got too old
G
And he called them miners mother Lord finders
                   D              G
Digging so deep in search of more gold

    D                            G
Oh where are the cowboys and the home on the range
    D                         G
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James
C                            G            C
Now the good guys on TV seem bad ain't it strange
        G                            D          G                       
And the old Nashville cowboys missed out on the change


G                            D             G
The old cowboy's life now is gone with the past
G                            Em           G
Like whiskey he drank it all went out too fast
G                          C            G
He didn't know how to make each swallow last
G                                    D           G
And a head waitress won't be back to fill up his glass

    D                            G
Oh where are the cowboys and the home on the range
    D                         G
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James
C                         G        C
Is anyone listening or is everyone blind
G                              D          G
And old Nashville cowboys will sing for a dime
G                               D           G
And hard times are cheap at the end of the line
