You Better Move On chords
The Rolling Stones (Alexander)

E

E                                     B7
You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love
                                   E
You tell me, I'm not the man she's worthy of
            E7              A           Am
But who are you to tell her who to love?
             E                 B7
That's up to her, yes, and the Lord above,
                E  B7
you better move on

        E  
Well, I know you can buy her fancy
            B7
clothes and diamond rings
                                      E
But I believe she's happy with me without those things
              E7    A           Am
Still you beg me to set her free
    E                    B7
But my friend, that will never be,
                E   E7
you better move on

     A                     E         E7
Now, I don't blame you for loving her
    A                                E      E7
But can't you understand, man, she's my girl
    A                           C#m        A
And I, never, never, ever gonna let her go,
     F#         B7
'Cuz I, yeah, I love her so

  E                                    B7
I think you better go now, I'm getting mighty mad
                                         E
You ask me to give up the only love I've ever had
        E7               A          Am
Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so
                E         B7
I'm never gonna let her go,
                E                   B7
you better move on (you better move on)
                E                   B7
you better move on (you better move on)
                E                   B7
you better move on (you better move on)
                E
you better move on
