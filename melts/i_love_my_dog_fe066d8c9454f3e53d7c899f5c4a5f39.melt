Tuning: eBGDAE

Tabbed By:Rundle

During this song, for the chords I like to use barre(9)chords, if you want use open
chords.

Enjoy =D

The E chord will start strumming half-way through that (in the intro),
add the opens on the low E string where you think necessary.


E
I love my dog as much as I love you
E
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.

B                          A
All he asks from me is the food to give him strength
B                             A
All he ever needs is love and that he knows he’ll get

E
So, I love my dog as much as I love you
E
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.

B                        A
All the pay I need comes shining through his eyes
B                             A
I don’t need no cold water to make me realize that

E
I love my dog as much as I love you
E
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.

D                       A
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana...
D                       A
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana...


E
I love my dog as much as I love you
E
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.


At this bit a trumpet, or whatever, plays the riff higher up the neck.
