C
Well Portland Oregon and sloe gin fizz

If that ain't love then tell me what is
   F       G
Uh huh, Uh huh
G
Well I lost my heart it didn't take no time
                                      C     G
But that ain't all. I lost my mind in Oregon


C
In a booth in the corner with the lights down low

I was movin' in fast she was takin' it slow
   F       G
Uh huh, Uh huh
G
Well I looked at him and caught him lookin' at me
                                          C     G
I knew right then we were playin' free in Oregon


F G F (G A# G A# G A# C)

C
Next day we knew last night got drunk

But we loved enough for the both of us
   F       G
Uh huh, Uh huh
G
In the morning when the night had sobered up
                                           C     G
It was much too late for the both of us in Oregon


C
Well sloe gin fizz works might fast

When you drink it by the pitcher and not by the glass
   F       G
Uh huh, Uh huh
G
Hey bartender before you close
                                        C
Pour us one more drink and a pitcher to go


C
And a pitcher to go
