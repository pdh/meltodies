                    Once upon a time there was an engineer
                                                              A7        D7
                    Drove a locomotive both far and near
                        G                                                        C
                    Accompanied by a monkey who would sit on his stool
                    G                        A7                 D7               G
                    Watching everything the engineer would move
                      G                                               C      G
                    One day the engineer wanted a bite to eat
                                                                 A7           D7
                    He left the monkey sittin' on the driver's seat
                     G                                                   C
                    The monkey pulled the throttle, locomotive jumped the gun
                    G                        A7                    D7                G
                    And did ninety miles an hour down the main line run
                                        G                         C       G

                                     Big locomotive comin' down the line
                                        G                                C

                    The Engineer called up the dispatcher on the phone

                    Tell him all about his locomotive was gone

                    Get on the wire, switch operator to write

                    Cause the monkey's got the main line sewed up tight

                    Switch operator got the message on time

                    Said, there's a northbound livin' on the same main line

                    Open up the switch, I'm gonna let her through the hole

                    Cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control

                                      Big locomotive right on time

                                      Big locomotive comin' down the line

                                      Big locomotive number ninety-nine

                                      Left the engineer with a worried mind
                                                    *Solo*   (verse (x2))

                                      Big locomotive right on time

                                      Big locomotive comin' down the line

                                      Big locomotive number ninety-nine

                                      Left the engineer with a worried mind

                                      G                   A7               D7         G
                                      Left the engineer with a worried mind

                                      Left the engineer with a worried mind...
