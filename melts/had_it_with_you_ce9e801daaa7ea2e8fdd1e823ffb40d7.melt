VERSE:
       A
      And I love you dirty fucker
      Sister and brother
         D
      Moaning in the moonlight
         A
      Singing for your supper
              E                                         A
      'Cos I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you
             E                                         A
      And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you


VERSE:
      Always try to taunt me
      Always seem to haunt me
      Serving out injunctions, shouting out instruction
      And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you
      And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it we're through
      I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you

VERSE:
      And I love you with a passion
      In and out of fashion
      Always up behind you
      Others tried to bind you
      And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you
      And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you
      I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you, oh, oh

INSTRUMENTAL: PLAY CHORDS TO VERSE

       A
      And it's such a sad thing to watch a love go down
            D
      I've had you up to here, babe
            A
      I've got to say good bye
                E                                   A* (START PLAYING
      'Cause I had it, had it, had it, had it with you   RIGHT AGAIN)
             E                                         A
      And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you


VERSE:
      Yeah, you know me in the lean years
      Loved you in the fat ones
      You're a mean mistreater
      You're a dirty, dirty rat scum!
      Yeah, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it we're through
      And I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it with you
      Oooh, I had it, had it, had it, had it with you

VERSE:
      Had it with you
      Had it with you
      Had it with you

      Had it with you
      Had it with you
      Had it with you
      Had it with you
