F#m        A     F#m       A      F#m    A   F#m   A
Now if you wanna hear some boogie like   I'm gonna play 
     A       F#m   A     F#m   A    F#m A                                 
It's just an old   piano and a knockout bass
    A       B      C        B    A       B C 
The drummer mans a cat they call Charlie McCoy
A         F#m A    F#m  A      F#m    A
You know, remember that rubber-legged boy?
A    B       C       B        A B   C 
Mama cookin' chicken fried in bacon grease
A       F#m   A    F#m  A    F#m      A    F#m
Come on along boys it's just down the road apiece

Well there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece
Well there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece
