Further On Up The Road:I believe this is a Springsteen song, the chord patterns 
would suggest it, I haven't heard the original, 
here's the version i use when I play.

                 | Am           | Am              |  C         | C
Where the road is dark,              and the seed is sowed,
                | Am            | Am               |  C         | C
Where the gun is  cocked,            and the bullet's cold,
                 |  Am         | G           | Am       | G                   
Where the miles are marked       in blood and  gold,

I'll   meet you further   on,       up the road,

Verse

                   | Am           | Am                   | C         | C 
Got on my dead man's suit,            and my smilin' skull ring,
               | Am            | Am              |  C         | C
My lucky graveyard boots,            and a song to sing
                | Am         | G                  |  Am       | G                   
I got a song to sing,          to keep me out of the cold
      |  F              |  G            |  Am         | Am stop 
And I'll meet you further on,   up the     road,

Chorus

                | C          |                 | Am       |  
Further on up the road,        further on up the road,
                | C          |                  |  E       |  
Where the way is  dark           and the night is  cold,
          | Am       | G           |  Am       | G   
One sunny   mornin'      we'll rise I know,
       | F              | G         | Am       | Am stop
And I'll meet you further on, up the  road,

Verse

                   |  Am           | Am             |  C         | C 
Now I been out in the desert,            just doin' my time,
                 |   Am            | Am             |  C         | C
Searchin through the dust,               lookin' for a sign,
                  |   Am         | G               |   Am       |G   
If there's a light up ahead,      well brother I don't know,
      | F              |   G            |  Am         | Am stop         
But I  got this fever,     burnin' in my   soul,
                   
Chorus

                | C          |                  | Am       |  
Further on up the road,        further on up the road,
               |  C          |                  | E       |  
Further on up the road,        further on up the road,
         |  Am       | G           |  Am       | G   
One sunny   mornin'      we'll rise I know,
       | F              | G         | Am       | G       |
And I'll meet you further on, up the  road,

Am       | G       | Am       | G       |  Am       | Am let ring
