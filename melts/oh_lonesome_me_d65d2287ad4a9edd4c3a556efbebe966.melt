Oh, Lonesome Me
Neil Young
After the Gold Rush

Richard Blackwell (rdb2010@shaw.ca)

I found a rendition of “Oh, Lonesome Me” by Neil Young on YouTube.  I capoed up 
four and tried playing along for a while.  This is what came out.

Neil seems to like to pull-off/hammer-on notes in his chords (e.g., in this piece 
the E (middle finger) in his open C chords, the A (again, middle finger) in his 
open F chords).  Those oh-so-Neil-like embellishments are not reflected here. 

Standard tuning
Capo on 4

Intro: C      F       C       F 

C           F             C            F
Everybody's going out and having fun.
C              F                C             F
I'm a fool for staying home and having none.
  C              C7             F      Fm   
I can't get over how she set me free.
Bb  F            C
Oh, Oh, lonesome me.

C                           F                C              F
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
C                F          C              F
Forget about the past, find somethin’ new
     C               C7              F   Fm 
I've thought of everything from A to Z,
Bb  F            C
Oh, oh, lonesome me.

  Dm                 G          Em            A7
I bet she's not like me.  She's out and fancy free
F                                   C
flirtin’ with the boys with all her charms.
    Dm               G      Em                A7
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
    F                 G               C
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms.

C                           F                C              F
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
C                F          C              F
Forget about the past, find somethin’ new
  C              C7             F      Fm   
I can't get over how she set me free.
Bb  F            C
Oh, Oh, lonesome me.

C      F       C       F    
Am  C
