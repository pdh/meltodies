Intro:  E  G D  A7

           A7 
Think I'll get back on the highway
D7
I hope I'll see you soon
A7
Get back on it
Get back on it
          D7
Think I'll get back on the highway                  
I hope I'll see you soon
A7
Get back on it
Get back on it
  E             
I may be late in comin' though
G          D              A7
I got some things I gotta do

Don't let me see your tail lights
I pull a heavy load
Get back on it
Get back on it
Don't let me see your tail lights
I pull a heavy load
Get back on it
Get back on it
There ain't no way to stop it though
Oh it might explode


It's too late for General Custer
Too late for Robert E. Lee
Get back on it
Get back on it
It's too late for General Custer
Too late for Robert E. Lee
Get back on it
Get back on it
But I'll get back on the highway
before it's too late for me
Get back on it
Get back on it

Think I'll get back on the highway
I hope I'll see you soon
Get back on it
Get back on it
Think I'll get back on the highway
I hope I'll see you soon
Get back on it
Get back on it
I may be late in comin' though
I got some things I gotta do
