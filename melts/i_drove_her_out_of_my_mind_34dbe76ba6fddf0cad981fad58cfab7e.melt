Johnny Cash - I Drove her out of my mind

Album: Out among the stars

Intro: G  D

D
She gave me my walking papers


and ran off with someone new

G
Cuz he bought her things

                  D
my wages couldn't buy

     G
So i turned to ups and downers

D
and everything between

E                                        A
Still i can't get her good lovin' off my mind

                      D
Well today I bought a Cadillac


the kind she's always wanted

G
I called and asked her

                 D
if she'd like to ride

                     G
She said this is our last date

       A                   D
I said that's alright with me


cause tonight I'm driving her out of my mind

               G
Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise

             D
right off of Lookout Mountain


Cause she said I never took her out

      A
when she was mine

           G
She'll see all seven states

      D
as we drive to the pearly gates

                     A
tonight when I drive her out of my mind

All the papers will read "Lovers leap


again off Lookout Mountain"


Cause i wrote a note

     G            D
that called it suicide

       G
But my epitaph will say

               D
"he killed his pain yesterday

        E
when he finally drove that woman off his mind

         D
Well now here she comes to greet me


dressed to kill and so am I

         Gm
Hope she asks me if this

              D
cadillac will fly

G
And I know that I'll die laughin'

       D
when I show her that it will


when I drive that woman


right out of my mind

               G
Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise

             D
right off of Lookout Mountain


Cause she said I never took her out

      A
when she was mine

           G
She'll see all seven states

      D
as we drive to the pearly gates

                     A
tonight when I drive her out of my mind


They'll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash

                 G
down here in Chatanooga

           D             A
last night when he drove her

           D
out of his mind

D
yeah that Cadillac dealer's in for a big surprise too


99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month


Yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous
