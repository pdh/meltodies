America
Capo 3
Readjusted by Alex Olson.

A few notes:
+This song is in 3/4 time, with each chord (unless noted) lasting one bar.

+The chords are played folk style: pick the bass note first and strum the chord for the 
of the bar.

+During the "to (look for a)merica" part, the chords in parentheses (G Am G/B) are all 
one bar, lasting a quarter note each.

+During the 4 bars of F at the end of the first line of each verse, the F is played like this:
|-----1-1-1-1-|-----1-1-1-1-|-1---1-1-1---|-1---1-1-1---|
|-----1-1-1-1-|-----1-1-1-1-|-1---1-1-1---|-1h3-1-1-1---|
|-----2-2-2-2-|-----2-2-2-2-|-2h3-2-2-2---|-2---2-2-2---|
|-----3-3-3-3-|-----3-3-3-3-|-3---3-3-3---|-3---3-3-3---|
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|-1-----------|-1-----------|-------------|-------------|

+++This chord marking is based off of the wonderful tab by Jokke at UG.
+++I displayed it in this fashion so it is easier to play along to.
