Intro: 
D A  G D

Verse:
D                 F#m
T'was in another lifetime
G                 D
One of toil and blood
D                     F#m
When blackness was a virtue
G
And the road was full of mud
  D                 F#m
I came in from the wilderness
G
A creature void of form
      D                   F#m        G                D
"Come in," she said "I'll give ya, shelter from the storm"
