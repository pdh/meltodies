                        Bb                                     F
If We Make It Through December ev'rything's gonna be alright I know;
             F7          Gm7                        C7              F
It's the coldest time of winter and I shiver when I see the falling snow;
      F7                Bb
If We Make It Through December,
                                   F
Got plans to be a warmer town come summer time;
      F7       Gm7
Maybe even California,
C7    Gm7               C7               F
If We Make It Through December, we'll be fine;
                           Gm7
Got laid off down at the fact'ry
C7        Gm7                 C7           F
And their timing's not the greatest in the world;
           F7       Gm7           C7          Gm7          C7                 F
Heaven knows I been working hard, wanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girl;
F7                     Bb
I don't mean to hate December,
                                   F
It's meant to be the happy time of year;
       F7                Gm7                              C7            F
And my little girl don't understand why daddy can't afford no Christmas here;
                        Bb                                     F
If We Make It Through December ev'rything's gonna be alright I know;
             F7          Gm7                        C7              F
It's the coldest time of winter and I shiver when I see the falling snow;
      F7                Bb
If We Make It Through December,
                                   F
Got plans to be a warmer town come summer time;
      F7       Gm7
Maybe even California,
C7    Gm7               C7               F           Eb  Bb  F
If We Make It Through December, we'll be fine.
