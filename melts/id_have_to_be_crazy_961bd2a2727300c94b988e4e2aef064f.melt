Song: I'd Have to be Crazy
writer: S. Fromholz (poular by Willie Nelson)
     E          E7
I'd have to be crazy
    E           E7
To stop all my singin
    F#         F       C
and never play music again.
      E         E7
You'd call me a fool
     E        E7
If I put on a top hat
    B7          B7             B7 Em
and ran out to flag down the wind.
    E           E7
I'd have to be weird
    E           E7
to grow me a beard...
        A                            Am
just to see what the redknecks would do.
      E
But, I'd have to be crazy
B7           B7
plum out of mind
    A           Am      E
to fall out of love with you.

    E                 E7
Now I know I've done weird things
        E       E7
I told people I heard things
     F#           F        C
when silence was all that abounds.
      E             E7
Been days when it pleased me
   E         E7
to be on my knees
 B7                     B7                  B7  Em
following ants as they crawled cross the ground

E                       E7
I've been insane on a train
E                 E7
But I'm still me again
        A                         Am
and the place where i hold you is true...

E               E
So I know I'm alright
     B7         B7     B7
'case I'd have to be crazy
    A          Am        E
to fall out of love with you...



You know I
 E            F#       F  C
(and i don't intend to..)
     C                  E
But should there come a day,
E                       F#   F    C
when I say that i don't love you
C                 B7       B7
They can lock me away--ay--AY

E               E7
It sure would be dingy
E               E7
to live in an envelope
F#      F           C
waiting alone for a stamp


          E            E7
and you'd swear i was loco
    E         E7
to rub for a genie
 B7             B7     B7     Em
while burning my hand on lamp
Em                E
and i may not be normal
    Em        E
but nobo-d-y is...
    E           A            Am
So I'd like to say 'fore I'm through


E               E
I'd have to be crazy 
B7              B7
plum out of my mind
    A           Am      E
to fall out of love with you!!

REPEAT ONCE

END
