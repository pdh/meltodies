Verse
  E
I wish, I hope, I wonder
             A
Where you're at sometimes
             E
Is your back against the wall?
         A
Or just across the line
              E
Have you been standing in the rain
         A
Reciting nursery rhymes?
       E
Trying to recall
                       A
Some long lost kind of peace of mind
         D
Peace of mind
                 G
Try spending the night sometime
               D
All alone in a frozen room
                  A
Afterneath you've lain
                   E
Your Saddle in the rain


(Repeat Intro)


  E
I dreamed they locked God up
           A
Down in my basement
       E
And he waited there for me
             A
To have this accident
            E
So he could drink my wine
                  A
And eat me like a sacrament
    E
And I just stood there like I do
       A
Then I came and went
           D
I came and went
                 G
Like a bird in a foreign sky
              D
Couldn't even say good bye
                      A
Or come and share the pain
                   E
My Saddle's in the rain
