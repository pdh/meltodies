My Little Town
Words &amp; music by Paul Simon 1975



E             |
  In my little town

Em            |Em7/A A  |
   I grew up believ--ing

D              |Bm       |Am |  |
  God keeps His eye on us all

F               |C           |
  And He used to lean upon me

C+               |E7             |A   |
   As I pledged allegiance to the wall

Bm         |E
   Lord I recall

         |A   |
My little town


            A/G# |F#m   |
Coming home after school

Am6          |D9               
    Flying my bike past the gates

      |G        |E7 |F |
Of the factories

B                 |F      |
  My mom doing the laundry

F+            |A 
   Hanging our shirts

            |D     |  |
In the dirty breeze


             |G
 And after it rains

         |
There's a rainbow

   |                     |D
And all of the colors are black

    |Em                        |D
It's not that the colors aren't there

    |         |G |Dmaj7    |E   |
It's just imagin-ation they lack

                |Em7
Everything's the same

    |A             |D   |G |D |G |
Back   in my little town


D                       |C#m7 
Nothing but the dead and dying 

                 |Bm  |  |
Back in my little town

D                       |C#m7 
Nothing but the dead and dying 

                 |Bm  |  |  |
Back in my little town



A             |F#m |
  In my little town

Am6              |D9        
    I never meant nothin'

             |G          |E7 |F |
I was just my fathers son

Bb          |F    |
   Saving my money

Bb            |F    |
   Dreaming of glory

Bb                 |F    
   Twitching like a finger

      |F+      A   |D  |  |
On the trigger of a gun

       |D                       |C#m7 
Leaving nothing but the dead and dying

                 |Bm  |  |
Back in my little town 


Repeat and fade:

D                       |C#m7 
Nothing but the dead and dying

                 |Bm  |  |
Back in my little town
