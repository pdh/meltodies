          G
This is a strange affair
    C                               G                   C
The time has come to travel but the road is filled with fear
          G
This is a strange affair
   C                                 G                  C
My youth has all been wasted and I'm bent and grey with years

    F         C           G      C
And all my companions are taken away
    F           C            G               C
And who will provide for me against my dying day?
  F              C             Dm           Am       G
I took my own provision but it threw me and wasted away
          C  F G                       C
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Oh, where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now and taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed in the days of my youth?
They took me to illusion and they promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen, why do they need more
proof
This is a strange, this is a strange affair
