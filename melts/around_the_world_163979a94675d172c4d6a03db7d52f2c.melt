E5

E5         
Boy and girl fall in love
dreamin under stars above
meanwhile push comes to shove
 D     A   E
around the world

E5
leaders fall leaders rise
terror wears a thin disguise
not much room for compromise
 D     A   E
around the world
around the world

E5
surfers from seven seas
sharing with the submarines
experts count war machines
 D     A   E        E5
around the world

E5
people sweat in planted fields 
students study what is real
someone builds a laser shield
 D     A   E
around the world
around the world

hey! what's that you got on?     you're sure looking good tonight
C#m/A           B5/A  C#m/A       Am7          
where'd you pick that up anyway?  wow! you're looking beautiful!
    Emaj7        E6
hey! you are somethin' else tonight
Em7         Am7/E          Fmaj9        E5addA                E5
    so skin tight...       wooh,   yeah come on, lets go out!
E5
why do we have to hate
why do we incinerate
why don't we illuminate
 D     A   E
around the world
around the world
D              A
why don't we illuminate
why don't we illuminate
 D     A   E
around the world


Note: The last two, why don't we illuminate are supposed to be sung with
      "around the world" along with them.  It was hard to indicate in the
      above.
