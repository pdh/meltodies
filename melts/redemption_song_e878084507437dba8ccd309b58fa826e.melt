   G                      Em Em7
Old Pirates, yes, they rob I.
     C        G/B      Am7
Sold I to the merchant ships
G                  Em      C         G/B        Am7
minutes after they took I   from the bottomless pit.
       G            Em Em7
But my hand was made strong
C      G/B           Am7
By the hand of the Almighty.
   G                   Em    C   Am7    D/F#
We forward in this generation triumphantly.


                G    C       D        G
Won't you help to sing    these songs of freedom?
      C     D        Em   C  D       G      C 
Cause all I ever had,      redemption songs,
  D       G      C Am7  
redemption songs.


(D7)   G                           Em Em7
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,
            C          G/B          Am7
None but ourselves can free our minds.
G                        Em
Have no fear for atomic energy,
              C        G/B         D7
Cause none of them can stop the time.
    G                        Em Em7
How long shall they kill our prophets
         C      G/B         Am7
While we stand aside and look?
          G              Em
Ooh, some say it's just a part of it.
      C         Am7         D7
We've got to fulfill the book.



(D7)                G    C       D        G
Won't you help to sing    these songs of freedom?
      C     D        Em   C  D       G      C 
Cause all I ever had,      redemption songs,
  D       G      C  D       G      C D
redemption songs, redemption songs.
