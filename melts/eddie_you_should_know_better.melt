Pretty straightfoward, but a great song, enjoy.

Intro: F#m9,F#m9,F#m9,C#7(#9)  Repeat

F#m7       Bm7
Eddie, you should know better
F#m7         Bm7
Brother, you know you're wrong

Dmaj7                 C#m7
Think of the tears and fears
                  Bm7
You bring to your folks back home
       C#7(#9) C#7(B9)
They'd say, "Where did he go wrong, 
         F#m9
My Lord?"
   C#7(#9) C#7(B9)
We planned and worked hard 
        F#m9
From the very start
C#7(#9) C#7(B9)
Tried to make him better 
     F#m9
Than all the rest
      C#7(#9) C#7(B9)
But the brother proved to be
F#m9          F#m9   F#m9   C#7(#9)
So much less

F#m9,F#m9,F#m9,C#7(#9)


Same chords as before:

Eddie is everybody's friend
But sometimes we wonder now and then

The only time he'll choose you
When theres's something to lose through
His personal loss
And the friend pays the cost
All the time

Must be something' that's freezin' his mind
That has made him, through greed, so very blind
And I don't think he's gonna make it this time
