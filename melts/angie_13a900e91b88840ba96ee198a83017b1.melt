key: Am
  
    Am    E7      G         F         E7            Am 
    Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear? 
    Am    E7      G          F  E7            Am
    Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here? 
            G                          Dm           Am 
    With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats, 
    C          F             G 
    you can't say we're satisfied. 
        Am   E7       G         F      E7    Am
    But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried. 
 
    Am    E7                G             F       E7         Am
    Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said goodbye? 
    Am    E7               G          F         E7            Am 
    Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried? 
            G                                 Dm             Am 
    All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke, 
    C      F               G 
    let me whisper in your ear, 
    Am    E7      G             F       E7       Am
    Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here? 
 
    G                              Dm                 Am 
    Angie don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet. 
    C           F               G 
    I hate that sadness in your eyes. 
        Am    E7      G        F       E7        Am
    But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said goodbye? 
 
              G                          Dm           Am 
    With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats, 
    C          F             G 
    you can't say we're satisfied. 
        Dm                      Am 
    But Angie, I still love you baby. 
    Dm                           Am 
    Everywhere I look I see your eyes. 
    Dm                             Am 
    There ain't a woman that comes close to you. 
    C       F             Am 
    Come on baby dry your eyes. 
        Am    E7      G        F       E7     Am
    But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive? 
    Am    E7      G          F      E7        Am
    Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried.
