Words and Music bt Bob Dylan

(Moderately, with a beat)



Em           D                            Em
I’m walking    through streets that are dead

Em      D                          Em
Walking,  walking with you in my head      

               D         B               Am  Am7
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired

                     Em
And the clouds are weeping


Em     D                      Em
Did I    hear someone tell a lie?

Em    D                         Em
Did I   hear someone’s distant cry?

               D             B                    Am
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile

            Em
While I was sleeping

G A                   G A                 Em
     I’m sick of love      but I’m in the thick of it

G A                   G A                 Em
     This kind of love     I’m so sick of it




Additional lyrics:

I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them ’til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

I’m sick of love; I hear the clock tick
This kind of love; I’m love sick

Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I feel like I’m being plowed under
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder

I’m sick of love; I wish I’d never met you
I’m sick of love; I’m trying to forget you

Just don’t know what to do
I’d give anything to be with you
