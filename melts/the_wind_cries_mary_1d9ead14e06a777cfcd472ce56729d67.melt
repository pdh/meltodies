The other entry for this song is a half step away from being correct, the song is
in the key of E not F. Although I prefer playing it in F because it is easier to
sing, this is the correct way to play it.


Intro: A Bb B  D Eb E  A Bb B  D Eb E

 B             A                  E             B           A           E  
After all the jacks are in their boxes And the clowns have all gone to bed
         B       Bb   A              E
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
G           A             A Bb B          
Footprints dressed in red 
G           A            A Bb B  D Eb E  A Bb B  D Eb E
And the wind whispers Mary

 B          A           E             B                 A             E
A broom is drearily sweeping Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
 B        Bb A          E       
Somewhere a queen is weeping 
 G           A               A Bb B
Somewhere a king has no wife
 G              A          A Bb B  D Eb E  A Bb B  D Eb E
And the wind It cries Mary

  B                      A                E
The traffic lights They turn of blue tomorrow
    B           A                     E
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
    B         Bb A         E
The tiny island sails downstream 
          G          A              A Bb B
Cause the life that lived is Is dead
        G      A          A Bb B  D Eb E  A Bb B  D Eb E
And the wind screams Mary

 B         A          E           B            A           E
Will the wind ever remember The names it has blown in the past
           B                Bb  A             E
And with this crutch It's old age And it's wisdom
             G           A           A Bb B
It whispers No This will be the last
         G    A       A Bb B  D Eb E  A Bb B  D Eb E
And the wind cries Mary
