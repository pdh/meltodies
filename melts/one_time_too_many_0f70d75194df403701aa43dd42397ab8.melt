Intro:
C F Dm G

Verse:1

C
I let love die broke a woman's heart
                        F
Have only myself to blame
Dm                      G
Fate ran its course, I suffered a loss
            C           F C C7
I learned a lesson in pain
F                        G
I cheated and lied, I took love for granted
C      C7            F
Acting as cold as ice
   Dm
But it's all in the past
      G                      C      F C G
I won't make the same mistake twice


chorus:

C
Once is enough
                    F
It's one time too many
 Dm
Change is rough
   G          C       F C G
Ohh once is enough

Verse 2:

Love went through such a sudden change,
Takin' a turn for the worst
Joy turned to fear, the pain got so severe
Lord, I thought I was cursed.
You get what you give, it comes 'round full circle
Ooo and I paid the price
I lost love so fast
I won't make the same mistake twice.


refrain: from country to rock transposed???


I let love die, broke a woman's heart
And only myself to blame
Fate ran its course, I suffered a loss
Learned a lesson in pain
I cheated and lied, and took it all for granted
Acting as cold as ice
But it's all in the past
I won't make the same mistake twice

Once is enough
It's one time too many
The change is rough
Ohh once is enough

Love went through such a sudden change,
Takin' a turn for the worst
Joy turned to fear, the pain got so dear
Lord, I thought I was cursed.
You get what you give, it comes around full circle
Ooo and I paid the price
I lost love so fast
I won't make the same mistake twice.

Chorus

I cheated and lied, and took it all for granted
Acting as cold as ice
But it's all in the past
I won't make the same mistake twice


Chorus: 2X

The change is rough
Ohh once is enough

The change is rough
Ohh Once is enough
