May you always do for others
          D            A
And let others do for you
          D
May you build a ladder to the stars

And may you stay forever young

           Bm
May you always know the truth
           D                    A
And see the lights surrounding you
           D
May you always be courageous

Stand upright and be strong

And may you stay forever young

Chorus:

May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
May you stay forever young
