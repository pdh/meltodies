Johnny Cash: Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound
==================================================

Altered by Ben Gregory, spacewaster@rocketmail.com
I kept finding the same chords on each website I searched, and the
verses seemed wrong, so I vandalised the file to make it fit with 
the way Johnny Cash plays this song on his "Ain't No Grave" album.

Intro: 
Dm G C Am
Dm G C

       C    
It's a long and dusty road
       F       Em    Dm
It's a hot and heavy load
        G7                        C
And the folks I meet ain't always kind
         C
Some are bad and some are good
          F        Em        Dm
Some have done the best they could
G7                                    C
Some have tried to ease my trouble in mind

      Dm             G                C                Am
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Dm             G                C
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound 

          C
I've been wandering through this land
     F         Em     Dm
Just doin' the best I can
G7                                 C
Trying to find what I was meant to do
        
And the people that I see
        F       Em     Dm
Look as worried as can be
       G7                            C
And it looks like they are wanderin' too

      Dm             G                C                Am
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Dm             G                C
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound 

(instrumental)

      C    
But I had a little girl one time
        F         Em     Dm
She had lips like cherry wine
        G7                                 C
And she loved me, till my head went plum insane
          
But I was, too blind to see
        F         Em       Dm
She was driftin' away from me
       G7                               C
And my good girl went off on a midnight train

      Dm             G                C                Am
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Dm             G                C
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound 

(instrumental)

       C    
If you see me passin' by
        F           Em     Dm
And you sit and you wonder why
        G7                          C
And you wish that you were rambling too
          
nail your shoes to the kitchen floor
        F      Em      Dm
Lace'em up and bar the door
G7                                        C
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you

      Dm             G                C                Am
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Dm             G                C
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound 

  Dm             G                C                Am
I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Dm             G                C
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.
