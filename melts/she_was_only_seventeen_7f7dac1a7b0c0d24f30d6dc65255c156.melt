C            Am                F         G        C
Are they old enough to know if love will last for life?
C            Am            F        G     C
Isn't he too young to be a husband, her a wife?
    C             C7                F                Fm
Within the past I bet it's happened more than once before.
     C                Am          F       G        C
When someone else was seventeen, another, one year more.

Do we have the right to question love that seems so strong?
G                  D             G               G7
As long as God has no objections there can be no wrong.

C                 Am             F                  G
Let us hope their love is strong enough to meet the test.
      C             C7                F                Fm
Cause like I say, I bet it's happened more than once before.
