Capo on the 2nd fret.

Verse 1:
    D                                     G                                    D
    As we sat on the front porch of that old grey house where i was born and raised
       Bm                                 G                           D
    Stared out at the dusty fields where daddy always worked hard eveyday
         Bm                                     G                               D
    I think it kind of hurt him when i said "Daddy there's a lot that i don't know
         Bm                           G                      D
    But don't you ever dream about a life where corn don't grow"


Verse 2:
     D                          G                            D
    He just sat there silent staring in his favorite coffee cup
            Bm                              G                  D
    I saw a storm of mixed emotions in his eyes when he looked up
             Bm                          G                                    D
    He said "Son i know at your age it feels like this ol' world is turning slow
             Bm                             G                         D
    And you think you'll find the answer to it all,where corn don't grow"


Chorus:
 D                  Bm                  G
    Hard times are real,there's dusty fields
                         D
    No matter where you go
                         Bm                        G
    You may change your mind,'cause the weeds are high
                       D
    Where corn don't grow


Verse 3:
     D                               G                                   D
    I remember feeling guilty when daddy turned and walked back in the house
           Bm                               G                               D
    I was only seventeen back then but it seems like i knew more than i do now
            Bm                          G                        D
    I can't say he didn't tell me this city life's a hard row to hoe
          Bm                          G                       D
    It's funny how a dream can turn around,where corn don't grow


Chorus.

 D                       Bm                        G
    You may change your mind,'cause the weeds are high
                       D
    Where corn don't grow
