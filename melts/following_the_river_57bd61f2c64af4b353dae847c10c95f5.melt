Following The River 

G                          C         G                               C
There's something I should tell you, why don't you sit there in that chair
G              Bm           Em                A                     D
You're looking good today I love the way your comb's tucked in your hair
G                   C     G                           C
My cards are on the table but the drinks have all run out
G                 Bm                 Em                 A              D
There's been some other lads in this room with me we're really quite a crowd

G                     C      G                       C
It's hard to break it gently but I really thought it through
G       Bm                 Em          A          D
I don't think there's much future left for me and you 
D7
Me and you

Chorus:
G         F             C     Am     C                    F
I've been following the river til it joins hands with the sea.
C                  G      Am               D                      G   
I've been thinking of you so bad cause you always saw the best in me


You'll probably forget me and I'll fade back in the bar
Just a face disappearing without trace I'll be lost I'll be lost

One day I'll hear some laughter in a out-of-town caf√©  
I'll be reaching for your number I'll be calling out your name
Calling out your name

Chorus
