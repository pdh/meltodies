   G                 Em
Revenge, must be the reason
       C                            D
Why forgiveness was a thing I never knew

Someday soon, I know you plan to hurt me
          C                                     D
But don't count on gettin' back with things you do

     G                Em
Your heart, is like a window
       C                         D
When I look inside I see another man
    G                                  C
But go on and lie, tell him how you've fooled me
    C                                 D
But remember: I saw through your evil plan

(Chorus)

And I'll_____ always know_____
                 G
When you've been cheatin'
    G                C
And I'll_____ always know
     C             D

I'll always know

...And don't forget it, either
