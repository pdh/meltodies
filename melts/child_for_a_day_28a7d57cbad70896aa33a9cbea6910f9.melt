Child For A Day chords
Cat Stevens  1977 (Gordon / Travis)

Capo II

D A G A 2x

D       Em    G
I was a child
                A
Who ran full of laughter
D       Em          G           A
I was a child,  who lived for today
   G            A
My eyes full of sunshine
   D             Bm    (Bm/A/G)
My heart full of smiles
G       Em          A
I was a child for a day

D           Em       G
We were the children
                A
Who sang in the morning
D           Em
We were the children
    G              A
Who laughed at the sun
    D           A         D                Bm     (Bm/A/G)
Who listened to those who spoke with their wisdom
G          Em            A    A
We are the ones we would say, but

D             F#7      Bm
We're getting older as time goes by
         D          G       E7
A little older with everyday
D                   A         D
We were the children of yesterday

D A G A

D          Em  G    A
We are the men  who worry of nothing
D          Em  G    A
We are the men  who fight without aim
   G         A           D            Bm    (Bm/A/G)
We listen to no one, yet speak of our wisdom
G          Em           A
We are the pawns in the game

D             F#7      Bm
We're getting older as time goes by
         D          G       E7
A little older with everyday
D                   A         D
We were the children of yesterday

   G            A
My eyes full of sunshine
   D             Bm    (Bm/A/G)
My heart full of smiles
G       Em          A
I was a child for a day but

A little older with everyday
D                   A         D
We were the children of yesterday
