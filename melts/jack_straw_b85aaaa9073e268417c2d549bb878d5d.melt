E                F#m                     C#m  A
We can share the women, we can share the wine
 
E                 Bm                  D        A                  E  G#m D  A
We can share what we've got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine.
 
E                F#m            C#m  A
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go,
 
E                Bm     D             A               E   B  A  A  E7
Keep on rollin', my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow.
 
Esus7             E7        Esus7             E7
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence,
 
Esus7                E7               Esus7             E7
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that heaven sent?
 
F#sus7           F#7              F#sus7           F#7
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, burns my eyes to see,
 
F#sus7            F#7                  F#sus7             D  Bm  A  E
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well been me.
 
D   Bm               A                       E
We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
 
D              Bm        A                                  E
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife.
 
D           Bm     A                        E
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall;
 
D              Bm        A         E                     A
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all,
 
         D  G  D  G  E  Esus4  E  Esus4  E
Not with all.

Got to settle one old score, one small point of pride.

F#sus7           F#7              F#sus7           F#7
Ain't no place a man can hide, Shannon, to keep him from the sun;

F#sus7            F#7                  F#sus7             D  Bm  A  E
Ain't no bed can give us rest, now, you keep us on the run.

One man gone and another to go, my old buddy you're moving much

We can share the women, we can share the wine.
