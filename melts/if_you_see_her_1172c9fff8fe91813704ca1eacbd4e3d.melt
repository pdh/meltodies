IF YOU SEE HER, SAY HELLO- Bob Dylan

If you see her say hello, she might be in Tangiers
                    G     D                      Em Em/D A
She left here last early spring, is living there I hear
Bm               G     D                             G
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow
          Bm                 A
She might think that I've forgotten her

Don't tell her it isn't so

We had a falling out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
I always have respected her, for doin' what she did and gettin free
Whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on
&gt;From the night I tried to make her stay

I see a lot of people, as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Maybe I'm too sensitive, or else I'm gettin' soft

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, it all went by so fast
If she's goin' by this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time

NOTE:  This is taken more from the Bootleg Series version, since that 
guitar part is easier to hear, but the chords (i.e. intro and outro) 
follow the Blood on the Tracks version.  D, D(2) and D(3) are pretty much 
interchangable; its pretty impossible to tell which fingering is being 
used at any one given time.  By the way, Up to Me and You're Gonna Make 
Me Lonesome When You Go also sound like they're in open D or open E.

The intro is played at the 9th and 7th frets
AGAGAGetc until
D
The little run is just a scale in D
using the open string D, formed with fingers 132, play first the open A,
then on the same string, use finger 1 to play the B, then the little
finger to play the C# then play the D as part of the chord.
D-----0-------
A-024---------
The D/C and D/B (that's probably not their correct name....)

E-0--0-------------
B-3--3------------
G-0--0-----------
D-2--0-----------
A-3--2------------
E-x--x-----------

Any correction, suggestions welcome !
