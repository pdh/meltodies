Play With Fire chords
The Rolling Stones *

G D C Em

Em
Well, you ve got your diamonds and you ve got your pretty clothes

And the chauffeur drives your car

You let everybody know
          G    D    G                C            Em
But don t play with me, cause you re playing with fire

Em
Your mother she s an heiress, owns a block in Saint John s Wood

And your father d be there with her

If he only could
          G    D    G                C            Em
But don t play with me, cause you re playing with fire

Em
Your old man took her diamond s and tiaras by the score

Now she gets her kicks in Stepney

Not in Knightsbridge anymore
         G    D    G                C            Em
So don t play with me, cause you re playing with fire

Em
Now you ve got some diamonds and you will have some others

But you d better watch your step, girl

Or start living with your mother
         G    D    G                C            Em
So don t play with me, cause you re playing with fire
         G    D    G                C            Em
So don t play with me, cause you re playing with fire
