LODI

[G]Just about a year ago
I [C]set out on the [G]road
Seekin' my fame and [EM]fortune
And [AM]looking for a pot of [D]gold
[G]Things got bad, [EM]Things got worse
I [C]Guess you all know the [G]tune
Oh lord, [D]stuck in Lodi [C]again   [G]

I rode in on a grey hound
I'll be walking out if I go
I was just passing through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection
Ran out of songs to play
Came into town on a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
For every song I sung
And everytime I had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
