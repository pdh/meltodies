A                      D
Could be holding you tonight
D                         A
Could be doing wrong or doing right
A                              E
You don't care about what I think
E                               A
I think I'll just stay here and drink

A                                      D
Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
D                          A
A least you'll know what I feel
A                              E
Hey, take all the money in the bank
E                               A
I think I'll just stay here and drink

A                             D
Hey, listen close and you can hear
D                         A
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
A                               E
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
E                               A
I think I'll just stay here and drink

[INSTRUMENTAL: SAME PROGRESSION ONCE AROUND]

A                                 D
Hey, hurtin' me know don't mean a thing
D                                    A
Since love ain't here I don't feel a thing
A                                 E
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
E                               A
I think I'll just stay here and drink
