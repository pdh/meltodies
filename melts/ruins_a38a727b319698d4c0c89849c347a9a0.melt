Ruins  by  Cat Stevens

INTRO: D/F#  G   Gadd9  (x8)


D/F#                           G  D/F#                             G
    It's so quiet in the ruins,       walking through the old town,
D/F#                   G                   D/F#                   G
    Stones crumbling under my feet, I see smoke for miles around,
D/F#                  G             D/F#                        G
   Oh, it's enough to make you weep,    all that remains of the main street,
D/F#                  G       D/F#                        G
    Up in the park on Sunday,      dogs chasing, and the children playing,
F                  C          F                   C     A
  Old man with his head down,   can't see nothing more around…, no!


D/F#  G                         D/F#        G
        But he remembers how it used to be,   back in the old days,
Dsus4                           G                  Em
      So nice to see you coming back in this town again,
                            C                 G
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through,
            A
Having tea in the afternoon, 
Dsus4                           G                  Em     C   G   A
      So nice to see you coming back in this town again



         D/F#  G   Gadd9  (x3)


D/F#                           G   D/F#                  G
     Ah, but it's all changed,          Winter turned on Man,
D/F#                           G                        D/F#               G
     Came down one day when no one was looking, and it stole away the land,
D/F#                      G            D/F#                  G
    People running scared, losing hands,  dodging shadows of  falling sand,
D/F#                        G                     D/F#         G
    Buildings standing like   empty shells, and nobody helping no one else,
F                      C          F                      C      A
  Young child with his hands high,  ain't able to see no reason why…, no!



D/F#  G                          D/F#        G
         But he remembers how it used to be,
Dsus4                           G                  Em
      So nice to see you coming back in this town again,
                            C                  G
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through,
                 A
You better know what you're going through, now!


A                   B7                 D
  You came back to find your home is a black horizon,
     E7                  A                       B7
That you don't recognise,   evil destruction has taken everything,
D                          E7                       A
  You'd better walk on the side, while you're still walking,
             B7         D
Just keep on walking on down the street,
             E7                        A
Keep your distance from the people you meet,
                    B7                                 D
Oh, Lord, and you'd better watch your eyes, 'cause, if smoke gets in them,
      E7
Baby, you won't rise again!
Dsus4                           G                  Em    C   G   A
      So nice to see you coming back in this town again!


        D/F#  G   Gadd9  (x4)


D/F#                     G    D/F#                 G
     Where's it leading to?        Freedom at what cost?
D/F#                G                             D/F#       G
     People needing more, and more, and it's all getting lost,
D/F#         G      D/F#          G
      I want back!        I  want back! 
D/F#                           G
     Back to the time when the earth was green,
          D/F#                    G
There was  no high walls, and the sea was clean!
F                  C            F          C        A        D/F#   G   D
  Don't stop that sun to shine,   it's not yours or mine…, no!
