Here's Cat Stevens' "tuesday's dead"

Intro (rythym only):

                D-DDD-A-D-DDD-A

These chords are strummed in an up/down type pattern pretty fast,
Getting the rythym right is a cinch if you've ever heard the song

For the verses, a G chord is thrown in on every other line, so it
looks like:
               D---DDD---A---DD--D-A-D --GGG------------------AA-DD
Verse lyrics:  If I make a mark in time/ I can't say that mark is mine
I'm only the underline/ of the word / 'cause I'm like him, and just like you
I can't tell them what to do/ Like everybody else I'm searching through
What I've heard;

CHORUS:

[D]woah, [G]where do you go,[D] [G] when you don't want [A] no-one to
know[D]
[D] who [G] told tomorrow[D] [G] tuesday's dead[A] [D] {play intro part}

Other verses:
preacher won't you paint myy dream/won't you tell me where you've been
Show me what I haven't seen/ to ease my mind
'cause I will learn to understand/ if I have a helping hand
I wouldn't make another command/ all my life (CHORUS)

What's my sex what's my name/ All in all it's all the same
Everybody plays a different game/ that is all
for man may liive, and man may die/ searching for the question why
but if he tries to rule the sky/ he must fall (CHORUS)

Every second on the nose/thhe humdrum of the city grows
Reaching out beyond the throes/ of our time
we mind try to shake it down/do out best to break the ground
try to turn the world around/ one more time (CHORUS)


Sorry about the vague nature of these last two (my first two) posts,
I'll fix them If I ever slow down.  send list of my failures to:
