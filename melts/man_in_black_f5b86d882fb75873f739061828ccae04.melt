Bb
Well, you wonder why I always dress in  black.
                                        C           
Why you never see bright colors on my back, and
 Eb                Bb                 Eb           Bb
Why does my ap -  pearance, seem to have a sombre tone,
                 Am                                 E7
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

   Bb                                                       
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
                                         C           
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town.
    Eb             Bb                 Eb                  Bb
I wear it for the prisoner, who has long paid for his crime.
           Am                               E7                    
But is there because he's a victim of the crime.

    Bb
I wear the black for those, who've never read,
                                        C
Or listened to the words, that Jesus said,
   Eb                       Bb           Eb               Bb
About the road to happi - ness, through love and chari - ty,
           Am                                      E7
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

             Bb                                            
Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do sup - pose,
                                           C         
In our streak-of-lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
     Eb                 Bb              Eb                Bb
But just so we're re -minded, of, the ones who are held back,
   Am                                 E7
Up front there oughta be a man in black.           

   Bb                                        
I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
                                                 C                  
For the reckless ones, whose bad trip left them cold,
    Eb                   Bb             Eb                    Bb
I wear the black in mournin', for the lives that could have been,
      Am                                E7
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.
