Blowing in the Wind - Bob Dylan

D        G             A        D                   G
How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a
D             G           A           D
man? how many seas must a white dove sail before she
G               A         D        G              A
sleeps in the sand? Yes n how many times must the cannon
       D                 G       D      
balls fly before they're forever banned? 
 
Chorus
 
G             A         D       A      G
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind the answer is
A              D
blowing in the wind
        

             Verse 2
                How many years can a mountain exist
                Before it is washed to the sea?
                How many years can some people exist
                Before they're allowed to be free?
                And how many times can a man turn his head
                and Pretend he just doesn't see?
                               
            (Chorus)

             Verse 3
                How many times must a man look up
                Before he can see the sky?
                How many ears must one man have 
                Before he can hear the people cry?
                How many deaths will it take till he knows
                that too many people have died?

            (Chorus)
