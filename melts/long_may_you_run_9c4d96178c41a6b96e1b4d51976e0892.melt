Long May You Run chords
Neil Young *

D A G D  Bm G A  D A G D  Bm A D

D          A            G        D      
We've been through some things together,
     Bm        G         D        A             
With trunks of memories, still to come.
D        A                G      D       
We found things to do, in stormy weather;
Bm   A       D    
long may you run. 
        
D            A    G        D        
Long may you run, long may you run; 
Bm             G            A    
although these changes have come.
D                      A    
With your chrome heart shining,
G      D    Bm   A       D   G  
in the sun; long may you run. 

Bb G D
   
                          A         G        D
Well it was back in Blind River, in nineteen sixty two;
Bm     G    D        A
When I last saw you alive.
D                  A           G      D
But we missed that ship on the long decline;
Bm   A       D
long may you run.

D            A    G        D        
Long may you run, long may you run; 
Bm             G            A    
Although these changes have come.
D                      A    
With your chrome heart shining,
G      D    Bm   A       D   G  
in the sun; long may you run. 
 
Bb G D

          A               G       D
Maybe the Beach Boys have got you now;
Bm         G             D   A
with those waves singing Caroline.
D       A         G     D
Rollin' down that empty ocean road,
Bm           A       D
Get into the surf on time.

D            A    G        D        
Long may you run, long may you run; 
Bm             G            A    
although these changes have come.
D                      A    
With your chrome heart shining,

G      D    Bm   A       D   G  
in the sun; long may you run. 

Bb G D
