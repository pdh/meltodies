Title:			THE WIND CRIES MARY	(Jimi Hendrix)
								    1967
		Intro:  E F F#   E F F# (repeat once)
		

		C#        B#  B                  F#
		After all the jacks are in their boxes
		C#             B#   B           F#
		And the clowns have all gone to bed
		C#                B#   B             F#
		You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
		G#        B          E F F#
		Footsteps dressed in red
		G#      B             E F F#  E F F#
		And the wind whispers Mary


		C#      B# B        F#
		A broom is drearily sweeping
		C#                   B# B           F#
		Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
		C#       B# B        F#
		Somewhere a queen is weeping
		G#          B           E F F#
		Somewhere a king has no wife
		G#           B     E F F#  E F F#
		And the wind cries Mary


 		(Solo)
                 You can strum verse chords as a background


		C#                 B#   B      F#
		The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
		C#                 B#     B          F#
		And shine the emptiness down on my bed
		C#         B#   B    F#
		The tiny island sags downstream
		G#                  B        E F F#
		Cause the life that lived is dead
		G#           B       E F F#  E F F#
		And the wind screams Mary


		C#       B#   B     F#
		Will the wind ever remember
		C#           B#  B            F#
		The names it has blown in the past
		C#                   B#  B            F#
		With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
		G#                   B#   B      E F F#
		It whispers no, this will be the last
		G#      B#   B     E F F#  E F F#  
		And the wind cries Mary
                
                
                
                Outro:  E F F#  E F F#
