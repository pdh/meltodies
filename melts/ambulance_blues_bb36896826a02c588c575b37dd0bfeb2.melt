Ambulance Blues
Words and Music by Neil Young
typed by Steve Vetter

*Tune guitar down one step, but I think it sounds all right if you don't*

C                        F 
Back in the old folky days
Am            Em              D
The air was magic when we played
C                                   F
The river boat was rocking in the rain
Am                Em            D
Midnight was the time for the raid
G
Oh Isabella, Proud Isabella
Am
They tore you down and plowed you under
Bm                             C
You're only real with your makeup on
G                 D
How could I see you and stay too long

C                        F
All along the Navaho Trail
Am                  Em                 D
burnouts stub their toes on garbage pails
C                          F
Waitresses crying in the rain
Am                   Em                 D
Will their boyfriends pass this way again?
G 
Oh Mother Goose, she's on the skids
Am
the shoe* ain't happy neither are the kids  
Bm                        C
She needs someone that she can scream at
G                    D
And I'm such at heel for making her so bad

C                                F
I guess I'll call it sickness gone
Am                   Em                D
It's hard to say the meaning to this song
C                              F
An ambulance can only go so fast
Am               Em               D
It's easy to get buried in the past
C                                  F
When you try to make a good thing last
Am   Em   D

G
I saw today, in the entertainment section
Am
There's room at the top for private detection
Bm             C
To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter
G                    D
But it's either that or pay off the kidnappers
C                          F
So all you critics sit alone
Am                    Em                        D
You're no better than me for what  you've shown
C                                               F
With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams
Am                 Em               D
We could get together for some scenes

G
Well I'm up in T.O.  keepin' jive alive
Am
and out on the corner it's half past five
Bm                        C
But the subways are empty and so are the cafes
G                              D
Except for the Farmer's Market and I can still hear him sayin'
C                                  F
"You're all just pissin' in the wind
Am             Em             D
You don't know it but you are"
C                              F
And there ain't nothing like a friend
Am                           Em              D
Who can tell you you're just pissin' in the wind

G
I never knew a man could tell so many lies
Am
he had a different story for every set of eyes
Bm                  C
How can he remember who he's talking to?
G                        D                        G(hold)
Cause I know it ain't me and I hope it isn't you
