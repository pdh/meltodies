This is a first attempt so go easy on me.
I'm sure this is not the same key as the recorded version.
But I haven't been able to find this anywhere.

Far Away Eyes       (M. Jagger/K. Richards)
G                                                 C
I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield
G                                              D
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station
        G                                     C
And the preacher said, "You know you always have the
G            D
Lord by your side"
G
And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran
         C                              G                 D
Twenty red lights in his honor Thank you Jesus, thank you lord

G   C   G   D

G                                                  C
I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late
G                                          D
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off
G                                                C
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find
G                                                D
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin in the corner
G                                 C
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear
      G         D        G
Was a girl with far away eyes
-------------------------------------------------------------
CHORUS:
             C            D
So if you're down on your luck
        G            C                       G           C
And you can't harmonize   (2ND TIME: I KNOW YOU ALL SYMPATHIZE)
       G         D         G
Find a girl with far away EYES
             C            D
And if you're downright disgusted
         G             C
And life ain't worth a dime
       G         D        G
Get a girl with far away eyes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
G                                                    C
Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send
G                                                D
Ten dollars to the church of the sacred bleeding heart of Jesus
G                                C
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California
G                                     D
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio
G                            C
And all my dreams would come true
G                                         D
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl
G                        D            G
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got
