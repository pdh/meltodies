VERSE: (other guitar plays opening riff)
        A            C             A            C
       Down in the graveyard where we have our tryst,
            A          C          A          C
       The air smells sweet, the air smells sick.
       A         C           A            C
       He never smiles, his mouth merely twists,
             A           C            A           C
       The breath in my lungs feels clinging and thick.
           A            C               A      C
       But I know his name, he's called Mister D.
            A            C               A       C
       And one of these days he's gonna set you free.
         A     C                 A               C
       Human skulls is hangin' right 'round his neck,
            A           C         A        C
       The palms of my hands is clammy and wet.

CHORUS:             A        G       C          A
       Lord, I was dancin', dancin' dancin' so free,
        A        G        C          A
       Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free.
        A        G               C        A
       Dancin', Lord, keep your hands off me,
        A            G        C  A
       Dancin' with Mister D.,
       A            A  G  C  A
       With Mr. D.,
       A            A  G  C  A
       With Mr. D.

VERSE:
       Will it be poison, put in my glass,
       Will it be slow or will it be fast?
       The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider,
       A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night.
       Hiding in a corner in New York City,
       Lookin' down a forty four in West Virginia.

CHORUS:

VERSE:
      One night I was dancin' with a lady in black,
      Wearin' black silk gloves and a black silk hat.
      She looked at me longin' with black velvet eyes,
      She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise.
      Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones,
      The eyes in her skull was burning like coals.
      Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone.
      I was dancin' with Misses D.


CHORUS:
      Lord, I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free,
      I was dancin', dancin', dancin' so free.
      Dancin', dancin', dancin' so free.

      Dancin', dancin'. -- fade out
