Intro:
D  A  E  A
D  A  E  A



A                   D
Back before I was a movie star
                    A
Straight off of the farm
                   E
I had a picture of another man's wife
               A
Tattooed on my arm
                     D
With a pack of Camel cigarettes
                        A
In the sleeve of my tee shirt
                   E
I'm headin' out to Hollywood
                         A
Just to have my feelings hurt



Chorus:
A                       D
That town will make you crazy
                      A
Just give it a little time
                            E
You'll be walking 'round in circles
                      A
Down at Hollywood and Vine
                       D
You'll be waitin' on a phone call
                      A
At the wrong end of a broom
                           E
Yes, that town'll make you crazy
           A
Crazy as a loon


A                    D
So, I headed down to Nashville
                    A
To become a country star
                          E
Every night you'd find me hangin'
                        A
At every honky-tonk and bar
                    D
Pretty soon I met a woman
                        A
Pretty soon she done me wrong
                        E
Pretty soon my life got sadder
                 A
Than any country song



(Repeat Chorus)


(Repeat Intro)



A                    D
So, I gathered up my savvy
                         A
Bought myself a business suit
                        E
I headed up to New York City
                          A
Where a man can make some loot
                   D
I got hired Monday morning
                    A
Downsized that afternoon
                         E
Overcome with grief that evening
                   A
Now I'm crazy as a loon


                      D
So I'm up here in the north woods
                  A
Just staring at a lake
                       E
Wondering just exactly how much
                     A
They think a man can take
                       D
I eat fish to pass the time away
                          A
'Neath this blue Canadian moon
                           E
This old world has made me crazy
           A
Crazy as a loon
                               E
Lord, this world will make you crazy
           A
Crazy as a loon



(Repeat Intro)
