   C                               C7
I took myself down to the Tally Ho Tavern
   F                  C
To buy me a bottle of beer
    F                      C            Am
And I sat myself down by a tender young maiden
     D                   G    G7
With eyes as dark as her hair
    C                                 C7
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle
    F                       C
For something un-foolish to say
    F                       C                Am
The silver tongued devil he slipped from the shadows
    G          G7        C
And smiling he stole her away
 
Chorus:       

        F                                                C
	I said hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil
        F                      C
        He's everything that I ain't
        F                    C    Am D                    G     
        Hiding intentions of evil,   under the smile of a saint
                 F                      C
        All he's good for is getting in trouble
            F                         C
        And shifting his share of the blame
        F                         C
        Some people swear he's my double
            D                       G    
        And some even say we're the same
                F                          C
        But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
        F                      C
        I'll only live 'till I die
           F                           C           Am
        We take our own chances, we'll pay our own dues  [pause}
            G              G7        C   F C
        The silver tongued devil and I


     C					     C7
Like all the young maidens who'd laid down beside him
    F                           C        
She knew in her heart that he'd lied
    F                         C               Am   
But nothing that I could have said could have saved her
   D                      G     G7 
No matter how hard that I tried
              C                                C7        
'Cause she'll offer charms to the darkness and danger
   F                          C 
Of something that she's never known
    F                    C          Am 
And open her arms to the smile of a stranger
       G            G7        C
Who'll love her and leave her alone

Chorus:       
                F              C
	And you know, he's the devil
	
(rest of chorus as above)
