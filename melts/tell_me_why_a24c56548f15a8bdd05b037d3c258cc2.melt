 Tell Me Why : After The Goldrush : Neil Young

 C                          
  Sailing heartships through

 D              
 Broken harbours

 Am7       (C) 
 Out on the waves

        G     (C)(G)     C
 In the night  

 Still the searcher must
 Ride the dark horse
 Racing along
 In his stride

 Chorus:
 D       Am7  C  G C G D
 Tell me why           

         Am7   C   G
 Tell me why       

       Bm                                 C   
 Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself

             D               C  
 When you're old enough to repay
     
     Bm7             Em  
 But young enough to sell

 C D Am7 (C) G

 Tell me lies later
 Come and see me
 I'll be around for a while
 I am lonely but
 You can free me
 All in the way that you smile

 Chorus

 C D Am7 (C) G
 C D Am7 (C) G

       
 Chorus

 C D Am7 (C) G   (to fade)
      

 notes:
           
 Am7 002010
 The Bm7 xx4232 is suspect, try a straight D (works better
 than A GM7)
 key transposition: (read as 'A C to A B-flat, A D to A C, etc)
 C/Bb D/C Am7/Gm7 G/A   D/E Am7/Bm7 etc..
