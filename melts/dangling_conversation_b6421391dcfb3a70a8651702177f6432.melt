Title:			THE DANGLING CONVERSATION	(Simon &amp; Garfunkle)

		C                 B     D
		It's a still life water color
		C             B    D
		Of a now late afternoon
		       C          B           Am
		As the sun shines through the curtain lace
		    G                     E  F#
		And shadows wash the room
		Em
		And we sit and drink our coffee
		F                              E
		Cast in our indifference, like shells upon the shore
		        D
		You can hear the ocean roar
                       C        B     D               G    D      C
		In the dangling conversation, and the superficial sighs
		                    G   Em  F#
		The borders of our lives

		C                 B     D
		And you read your Emily Dickenson
		C        B      D
		And I my Robert Frost
		       C        B          Am
		And we note our place with bookmarkers
		     G                       E  F#
		That measure what we've lost
		Em
		Like a poem porely written
		       F                     E
		We are verses out of rhythm, Couplets out of rhyme
		   D
		In syncopated time
		        C        B     D               G    D      C
		And the dangling conversation, And the superficial sighs
		                       G     Em  F#
                Are the borders of our lives

		C               B           D
		Yes we speak of things that matter
		     C          B       D
		With words that must be said
		   C     B      Am
		Can analysis be worthwhile
		       G
		Is the theatre really dead
		Em
		And how the room is softly faded
		      F                        E
		And I only kiss your shadow, I cannot feel your hand
		         D
		You're a stranger now unto me
		            C        B     D               G    D      C
		Lost in the dangling conversation, And the superficial sighs
		                      G     Em   F#
                In the borders of our lives
