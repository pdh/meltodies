Subject: CorrectedTab

Here is my rough attempt at tab for a Stones classic.  The songs is in

open G tuning (D  G  D  G  B  D).  If you want to really be Keith

Richards-esque, remove the low D string completely.

First there is the opening riff as follows:

D 12----12--12--12--12-----x----0------5----5--7----0-----------------

B 12----12--12--13--12-----x----0------5----5--7----0-----------------

G 12----12--12--12--12-----9----0------5----5--7----0-----------------

D 12----12--12--14--12-----9----0------5----5--7----0-----------------

G 12----12--12--12--12-----9----0------5----5--7----0-----------------

D --------------------------------------------------------------------

While I'm at it, I'll get all of the tab out of the way first.  Here is

the tab for the chorus parts:

        After   All is     said and    done

D 12----12--12--12--12-----x----x------7------------------------------

B 12----12--12--13--12-----x----x------7------------------------------

G 12----12--12--12--12-----9----9------7------------------------------

D 12----12--12--14--12-----9----9------7------------------------------

G 12----12--12--12--12-----9----9------7------------------------------

D --------------------------------------------------------------------

        I gotta move while it's still  fun

D 12----12--12--12--12-----x----x------7------------------------------

B 12----12--12--13--12-----x----x------7------------------------------

G 12----12--12--12--12-----9----9------7------------------------------

D 12----12--12--14--12-----9----9------7------------------------------

G 12----12--12--12--12-----9----9------7------------------------------

D --------------------------------------------------------------------

        I   better walk  before they   make    me   run

D 12----12--12--12--12-----x----0------5-------7----0-----------------

B 12----12--12--13--12-----x----0------5-------7----0-----------------

G 12----12--12--12--12-----9----0------5-------7----0-----------------

D 12----12--12--14--12-----9----0------5-------7----0-----------------

G 12----12--12--12--12-----9----0------5-------7----0-----------------

D --------------------------------------------------------------------

Some chords you'll need to know in open G

     D  G  D  G  B  D

     ----------------

G    0  0  0  0  0  0   and also  12 12 12 12 12 12

C    5  5  5  5  5  5

D    7  7  7  7  7  7

Emin x  9  9  9  x  x

F   10 10 10 10 10 10

A#   3  3  3  3  3  3

A common Keith chord is like you see on the fourth chording in the

opening riff.  It is like hammering on the same chord position you would

call in standard (concert) guitar tuning for A minor augmented.

For a C position chord, the hammer on would go:

           D  G  D  G  B  D                       D  G  D  G  B  D

  C-chord  5  5  5  5  5  5    hammer on F-chord  5  5  7  5  6  5

If you can do this, you can play Start Me Up, Brown Sugar, etc. etc.

etc...



                  Better Walk Before They Make Me Run

                         by Jagger/Richards

(opening riff)

F          Emin     D          F        Emin       D

Worked the bars and sideshows along the twighlight zone

G

Only a crowd can make you feel so alone

G

And it really hit home

F         Emin      D                F          Emin D

Booze and pills and powders, you can choose your medicine

G                                           D

Well here's another goodbye to another good friend

(use chorus tab)

After all is said and done

I better move while it's still fun

I better walk before they make me run

Watched the taillights fading, there ain't a dry eye in the house

They're laughing and singing

Started dancing and drifting as I left town

Gonna find my way to heaven, `cause I did my time in hell

I wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well

After all is said and done

I better move I had my fun

I better walk before they make me run

(bridge) G - D - F - C - A#

         G - D - F - C - A#

         G - D - F - C - D

After all is said and done

I better move, it's still fun

I better walk before they make me

I better walk before they make me

I better walk before they make me run
