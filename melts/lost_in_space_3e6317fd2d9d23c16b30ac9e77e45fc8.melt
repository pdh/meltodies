             F  C
Live with me, 
             F  C
live with me
Bb           C
Lost in space
                     F        Bb
I heard you were lost in space
                  Gm       C             F  C
That's such a lonely place for you to be

Out of control
Singin' with too much soul
I heard you got out on parole
Workin' for the queen

          F
Gardening again
C          F
Landscape again
Bb                   C                 F   C
Keepin' all the grounds around her clean
                     F  C
Workin' for the queen
Bb  C  F  Bb  Gm  C  F  C

Bb                    C
Don't take out the magic pen
F                   Bb
Don't draw on the infinity board
     Gm                   C
Your buildings if they rise again
      F       F/E           F     F/E
Would do much better on the ocean floor
        Bb               C                 F  C
They'll never feel the way they did before
                F   C
They did before

"Out on the ocean floor, out on the ocean floor
              Bb                F       Bb
What could be stranger than the unknown danger
C                      F
That lies on the ocean floor?"

Bb                         C
Breakers crash on the beach
                      F            Bb
I count them like lambs in my sleep
Bb              Gm
They come at me steady
                  C
They know I'm not ready
                    F          C
They pound on my mattress door
                           F
Have they got a big one in store

Bb
Losing you
C               F       Bb
I heard I was losing you
               Gm         C                F  C
That's not the only thing that I got to lose
               F  C
I got to lose
                    F  C
The deep see blues
                    F  C
Look at these blues
                  F  C
The deep see blues
             F  C
Live with me, 
             
live with me.
