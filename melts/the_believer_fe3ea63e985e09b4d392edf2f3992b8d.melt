The Believer

A                        D                  A
I'm just a believer baby in those dreams of mine
                                 D               A
You see they just keep on comin' in a long, long line
   D     A       D       
Oh yeah, I'm the believer

And like that songbird singin' whether it's red or blue
Just like those church bells ringin' I'm keepin' my faith in you
Oh yeah, I'm the believer
Oh yeah, I believe in you

Bm             E              A          D
And though the seas may rise, until they do
Bm               E                A              D
I keep doin' the things I'm doin' and believe in you
Dm             E           G7                  A
I'm makin' the change, I'm keepin' my faith in you
   D     A         D
Oh yeah, I'm the believer
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Sure is a windy road that I walk with you
Look how the trees are bendin' their leaves are fallin' too
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm the believer, babe, oh yeah

I remember my mama saying I want to be
On this windy road for eternity
I'm makin' the change I'm keepin' my faith in you
Oh yeah, I'm the believer, babe
I believe in you
Oh yeah, I'm the believer, babe
