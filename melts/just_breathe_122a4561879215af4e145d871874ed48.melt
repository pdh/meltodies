Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh

Stay with me

your all I see

No one knows this more than me

But I come clean

Nothing you would take, everything you gave

G                Dm7
Did I say that I want you?

Oh, if I didn?t I?m a fool you see
F                 C         G
No one knows this more than me
    G
But I come clean

Love you till I die, meet you on the other side
