[A]Early one morning the sun[G] was shinin'
[A]I was layin' in be[G]d.
[A]Wondering if she'd chan[G]ged at all
If her [D]hair was still red.
[A]Her folks they said that our live[G]s together,
[A]Sure was gonna be roug[G]h.
They [A]never did like Mama's [G]home-made dress,
Papa's b[A]ank book wasn't big enough.
And [E]I was standing on the [F#m]side of the road,
[A]Rain falling on my sho[D]es.
[E]Heading out for the old east[F#m] coast,
Lord kn[A]ows I've paid some d[D]ues,
Getting throug[E]H,
[G]Tangled [D]up in blu[A]E.[Asus4][Asus2][A][Asus4][Asus2]


She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a sad dark night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over her shoulder
We'll meet again some day
On the avenue
Tangled up in Blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that  much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I was lucky to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen alot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

{np}
She was working in topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me Don't I know your name
I muttered something undernaeth my breath
She studdied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello she said
You look like the silent type
Then open up a book of poems 
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
&amp;gt;From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
&amp;gt;From me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started dealing in slaves
And something inside of died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when the bottom finally feel out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going on back again
I got to get to her some how
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenters wives
Don'ty know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue.
