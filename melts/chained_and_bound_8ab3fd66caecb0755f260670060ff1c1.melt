Verse 1:

G             C
 Darling, now, you made me change my mind.
G       D
 Can go no further;
G                   D
 Because you got me chained and bound.

Verse 2:

G                G7            C
 Taller than the tallest pine, sweeter than a grape on a vine.
G          D
 Can go no further;
G                   D
 Because you got me chained and bound, right now, now.

Verse 3:

G                     C
 So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad,
                          G
Oh, I don't have to worry no more,
D7        G         D
 Oh my my my, baby, somebody, somebody.

Bridge 1:

Em                                  G
 What kind of life is this kind I'm living?
                                  Em
Oh Lord, what kind of love is she trying to give me?
                                            G
I feel like I'm standing up and telling the world;
    G       G/F# G/E  D
I'm chained to   your love.

Verse 4:

G            C
 Darling, oh, don't break this little heart of mine.
G        D               G                  D
 There's no greater love, than this love of yours and mine.

Verse 5:

G                                   C
 You walk with your head in the sky, darling, don't ever pass me by.
G                 D
 I ain't going no further,
G                   D
 Because you got me chained and bound.

Coda:

G                             C
 So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad,
                            G
Lord, I don't have to worry no more.
           C
She got me chained to her love,
                G
now, I don't, I don't want to be taken away.
                                      C
I'm chained, I'm chained and a little bound, now, now, now,
                                 G
I'm chained, I'm chained to your love.
                                                     C
I don't, I don't know darling, I wanna to be taken a-way, now.
                         G                          C
Oh, just a little bit of soul, just a little bit of soul, now...
