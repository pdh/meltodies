CAPO 1


D 
Why don't you write me, 

   |   
I'm out in the jungle, 

   |E                  |  | 
I'm hungry to hear you. 

A7  
Send me a card, 

    | 
I am waiting so hard 

     |Bm     |F#m | 
To be near yo-ou. 

D     |G        | 
  (La, la, la) 

             |D 
Why don't you write? 

            | 
Something is wrong 

                   |E7       |  | 
And I know I got to be there. 

A7          
Maybe I'm lost, 

     |  
But I can't make the cost 

      |Bm      |F#m |D 
Of the airfare, ooh 

        |G        | 
 Tell me why, why, why 

       |A        |   | 
Tell me why, why, why 


D            
Why don't you write me, 

 |   
A letter would brighten 

  |E                  |  | 
My loneliest evening. 

A7  
Mail it today 

       | 
If it's only to say 

           |Bm         |F#m | 
That you're Ieaving me, oo 

D     |G      |D  |D7 | 
  (La, la, la) 


G7                                | 
Monday morning, sitting in the sun 

                                       | 
Hoping and wishing for the mail to come 

D                         |D7 | 
Tuesday, never got a word, mmm. 

G7                                 | 
Wednesday, Thursday, ain't no sign, 

                                | 
Drank a half a bottle of iodine. 

D  
Friday, woe is me 

   |D7                        |G           | 
I'm gonna hang my body from the highest tree. 


              |D 
 Why don't you write me? 

              |G 
 Why don't you write me? 

              |D
 Why don't you write me?
