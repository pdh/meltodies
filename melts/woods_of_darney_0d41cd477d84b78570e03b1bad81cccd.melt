Am
I found your picture in a corporal's pocket
Gadd9
His cold fingers still pressed it to his chest
Bm
Sniper's bullet took his eyes and his breath away
F
Now he lies out in the forest with the rest

Am
You looked shy in your grandmother's wedding dress
Gadd9
Feet set wide like a farm girl stands
Bm
Too young to love and too young to lose
F
In a cracked picture frame in a dead man's hands

Dm
I kept it with me for the luck, for the magic
Am
Maybe fate wouldn't strike in the same place twice
Em
But something stirred and I dared to dream of you
Bb
And I knew I'd look for you if I should survive

Am
When we stood down at last it was easy to find you
Gadd9
Mine was the shoulder you cried on that day
Bm
Just an old comrade doing his duty
F
Bringing the news from the Woods of Darney

C
When I showed you the picture perhaps I felt jealousy
Gadd9
As your tears welled up with each reminisce
Dm 
And my hands may be rougher and my tongue may be coarser
Am
But I knew I could give you a love good as his

(bridge is F G F G F Dm)

Am
Now we lie in the darkness together
Gadd9
Often we lie without speaking this way
Bm
As you stare in the dark do you see your young corporal
F
Who never came back from the Woods of Darney

Am
Is it him that you see when we make love together
Gadd9
Is it him that you see when war fills the sky
Bm
Was he there as you stood in your grandmother's wedding dress
F
As we made our own vows, you and I

Dm
Now the bugle calls, they say this is the big one
Am
A curse on the life of a soldier you say
Em
But don't you know that's a soldier's small comfort
Bb
For the bugle to sound, and to hear and obey

Am
And I'll carry your picture the one that he carried
Gadd9
I'll wear your innocence and take my chance
Bm
On a frozen field, in a far-flung war
F
To win back what we lost in a field in France

Am
And it's many a soldier who goes into battle
Gadd9
Your corporal and I, we just hear and obey
Bm
Perhaps we'll lie in the darkness together
F
With your love to bind us, in the Woods of Darney.

Writing it down like that looks pretty incomprehensible, but the songs 
are rhythymically simple: one chord every four bars in Darney,
