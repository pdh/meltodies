C                F/C
Here we stand in sheets of rain
Bb            Am
Parting ways, loved in vain
Dm               Ab     Gm       F
Never knew you'd be the reckless kind

C                F/C
I reached out to catch your fall
Bb                Am
Said you needed a place to crawl
Dm               Ab     Gm       F
Never knew you'd be the reckless kind

             Bb   Ebsus2
The reckless kind
             F
The reckless kind
             Bb    Gm
The reckless kind
             Dm
The reckless kind
       Bb       F
You're his, not mine


Say you run with a breakneck crowd
Live your love scenes right out loud
Break hearts all around you're the reckless kind

Said you were well satisfied
Proud to see me by your side
Pride's a worthless thing to the reckless kind

The reckless kind
The reckless kind

Love lies shattered on the ground
Jagged pieces all around
Say you'll come back, but I know you're the restless kind

The reckless kind
The reckless kind

You're his, not mine
His, not mine
The reckless kind
The reckless kind
