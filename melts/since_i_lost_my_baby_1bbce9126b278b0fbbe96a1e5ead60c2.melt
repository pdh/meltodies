SINCE I LOST MY BABY
by The Temptations, 1965
tabbed by Rob Stahl (rgs25@drexel.edu)

Key of Eb     Capo I and play in D

(Intro)
D                 F#m
D       F#m       G     D    x2 (with strings)

    D      F#m              G         D
The sun is shining, there's plenty of light (oh yeah)
  D          F#m      G         D
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright (oh yeah)
    D
But after I've been crying all night
    D      F#m           G             D
The sun is cold, and the new day seems old

(CHORUS)
D
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
    G
Oh, since I lost my baby (Oh, since I lost my baby)

The birds are singin’ and the children are playin’
There's plenty of work and the bosses are payin’
Not a sad word should a young heart be sayin’
But fun is a bore and with money I'm poor

(repeat CHORUS)
G                         
Next time I'll be kinder (Next time I'll be kinder)
          D                                  D
Won't you please help me find her (Won't you please help me find her)
G                        G
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her)
        D                                 D
Of this love she left behind her (Of this love she left behind her)
       G                                  G
‘Til I find her I'll be tryin’ ta (‘Til I find her I'll be tryin’ ta)
     G       D      G      D       G      D
Everyday I'm more inclined ta      find  her
  G      D      G    D      G G      G  A    A  D
Inclined ta     find her    Inclined ta find my baby
G                         D            G                        G G G A A A
 Been looking everywhere (Ba--by) Baby   I really, really care!

Oh, determination is fading fast (oh yeah)
Inspiration is a thing of the past (oh yeah)
Can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad and what's happy is sad

(Outro)
D
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
    G                      G   G    G  A A A    D
Oh, since I lost my baby  (since I …) I feel so bad   (since I lost my baby)
          G         G     G     G  A A A    D
I feel so sad   (since I …)   Everything is wrong   (since I lost my baby)
                            G      G     G      G  A A A    D
This heart is hard to carry on  (since I …)  I'm lost as can be   (since I …) 
                       G
What's gonna happen to me?

(fade)
