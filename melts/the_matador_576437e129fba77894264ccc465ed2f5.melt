The Matador

A – D – A


A                            D 
The crowd is waiting for the bullfight
A
Matador

E                                 A    
My final fight the place is packed once more
A                     D              A   
But Anita won’t throw me a rose this fight
        E                       A          
The one she wears is not for me tonight


Chorus

E                                D 
She’s watching now with her love I know
     A 
Walk proud and slow
E                              D      
Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
            A        
They want blood you know! 
A                        D             A   
You’re still their idol as you were before
D               A      
Kill just one more!
A                       E            A
Remind Anita, you’re the greatest Matador


A                      D                   
walk on out, forget Anita
         A
in the stands
E                                 A
Be a tall and strong and brave and noble man
A                     D                
Be better than you’ve never been
A
before
E
Make this your greatest moment 
A
Matador

CHORUS

E                                D 
She’s watching now with her love I know
     A 
Walk proud and slow
E                              D      
Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
            A        
They want blood you know! 
A                        D             A   
You’re still their idol as you were before
D               A      
Kill just one more!
A                       E            A
Remind Anita, you’re the greatest Matador
