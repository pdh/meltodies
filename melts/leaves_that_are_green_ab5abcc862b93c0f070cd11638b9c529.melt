                  Em        A7             D
I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song,
                           G    C        D
I'm twenty-two now, but I won't be for long,
             A7
Time hurries on,
          D     C       G Em7  A7       D
And the leaves that are green turn to brown.
          Bm         
And they wither with the wind,
          Em7
And they crumble in your hand.
D                  Em        A7             D
Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl,
                           G    C        D
I held her close, but she faded in the night,
                        A7
Like a poem I meant to write,
          D     C       G Em7  A7       D
And the leaves that are green turn to brown,
           Bm
And they wither with the wind,
           Em7
And they crumble in your hand.
    D      Em    A7    D
I threw a pebble in a brook,
                         G  C D
And watched the ripples run away,
          G            A7
And they never made a sound,
           D     C       G Em7  A7       D
And the leaves that are green turned to brown,
           Bm
And they wither with the wind,
           Em7
And they crumble in your hand.
D      Em       A7    D
Hello, hello, hello, hello,
     D                G     C   D
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
G                A7
That's all there is,
           D     C       G Em7  A7       D
And the leaves that are green turned to brown.
