Verse:

G                           C                    
Jesus Christ was a man that traveled through the land
G                    D
Hard working man and brave
G                               C            
He said to the rich, "Give your goods to the poor."
        G          D             G
So they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

Chorus:

     C                  G
Yes, Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand
                       D
His followers true and brave
G                       C            
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
    G         D            G
Has laid poor Jesus in his grave

Verse:

He went to the preacher, he went to the sheriff
Told them all the same
Sell all of your jewelry and give it to the Poor
So, they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

When Jesus come to town, the working folks around
Believed what he did say
The bankers and the preachers they nailed him on a cross
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

Now, the working people, follered him around
Sing and shouted "Gay"
But the Cops and the soldiers, nailed him in the air
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

Well the people held their breath when they heard about his death
Everybody wondered why
It  was the landlord and the soldiers that he hired
That nailed Jesus Christ in the sky

This song was made in New York City
Of rich mans, and preachers, and slaves
If Jesus was to preach like he preached in Galillee
They would lay Jesus Christ in his grave

Chorus:

Yes, Jesus was a man, and a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
Has laid poor Jesus in his grave
