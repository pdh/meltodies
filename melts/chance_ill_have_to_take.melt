erse 1: 
         D                         A 
      Troubles and a worried mind 
                                        D 
      It seems that's all i've ever known 
                                    A  
      But now i leave that all behind 
                                  D 
      If you'll just leave me alone 

Refr√£o 
         /                     Em 
      And if i go on loving you 
         A                      D                   
      If to leave is a mystake 
                                Em 
      If i'm wrong in what i do 
         A                                 D  
      That's the chance i'll have to take


Verse 2: 
         D                                A 
      Don't bother now to waste the time 
                                     D 
      Sayin' things you've said before 
                                     A 
      I've heard it all a hundred times 
                               D 
      But i won't listen anymore       
 
 
Chorus.
