E
Well in my time of dyin'
Don't want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do
Is take my body home
Well well well so I can die easy
Well well well
Well well well so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dyin' bed

A
Well meet me Jesus meet me
meet me in the middle of the air
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Won't you meet me with another pair
Well well well so I can die easy
Well well well
Well well well so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dyin' bed
