Boots Of Spanish Leather 
Bob Dylan



       Em               C        G     
Oh I'm sailin' away my own true love
    Em      D/F#        G       
I'm sailin' away in the morning
         Em                             C         G                          
is there something I can send you from across the sea
        Em          D/F#    G       
From the place that I'll be landing?

         

           Em                           C        G     
No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
        Em      D/F#         G       
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'
     Em                     C      G   
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
      Em          D/F#    G  
From across that lonesome ocean.


          
         Em                      C        G 
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
      Em       D/F#    G  
Made of silver or of golden
       Em            C           G 
Either from the mountains of Madrid
        Em          D/F#    G  
Or from the coast of Barcelona ?


          Em                        C        G 
Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
        Em                 D/F#    G
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
    Em                    C         G
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
           Em        D/F#        G
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.
     


       Em               C      G
That I might be gone a long time
     Em        D/F#    G
And it's only that I'm askin'
         Em                C            G
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
        Em            D/F#   G
To make your time more easy passin'?



        Em               C      G
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
    Em     D/F#    G
It only brings me sorrow
        Em                 C             G
But the same thing I would want from you today
       Em     D/F#    G
I would want again tomorrow.



       Em                C        G
When I got a letter on a lonesome day
       Em       D/F#    G
It was from her ship a-sailin'
       Em                         C          G
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
       Em      D/F#    G
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.


         Em                  C         G
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way
      Em      D/F#    G
I'm sure your mind is roamin'
       Em                   C       G
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
           Em            D/F#       G
But with the country to where you're goin'.

         Em                    C        G 
So take heed, take heed of the western wind
       Em       D/F#    G
Take heed of the stormy weather
     Em                             C        G   
And yes, there's something you can send back to me
         Em       D/F#    G
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.
