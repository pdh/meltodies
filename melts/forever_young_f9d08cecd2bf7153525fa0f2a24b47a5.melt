Forever Young by Bob Dylan

          D
May God bless and keep you always,
          F#m/C#
May your wishes all come true,
        G/B           
May you always do for others
        G               D            
And let others do for you.
          D
May you build a ladder to the stars
       F#m/C#      
And climb on every rung,
         G/B      A         D
May you stay        forever young,
        A7         Bm
Forever young, forever young,
        D         A7        D
May you stay        forever young.  

(repeat the chords till the end)

May you grow up to be righteous,
May you grow up to be true,
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you.
May you always be courageous,
Stand upright and be strong,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.

May your hands always be busy,
May your feet always be swift,
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift.
May your heart always be joyful,
May your song always be sung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.
