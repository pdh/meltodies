 |C     G               F                 D           |
  She's my best friend, certainly not the average girl
 |C     G              F              D
  She's my best friend understands me when I'm fallin'
  G     D     G    |
  down, down, down.
       |C        F       G    G     D     G    |
  Oh it hurts to be that way, Down, down, down!

 
       |C        Am       D           G    | 
  Oh it hurts to know the bad kind of fella
 |C                   D     F                         C   |
  here's to newspaper Joe...dropped his teeth on the floor
 |C                      D      | 
  Caught his hand in the door,
 |F                              C|
  guess that's the way the news goes

                    |D   F                 G     C   |
      If you want to see me, sorry but I'm not around
                    |D  F      C    Am           
      If you want to be me... turn around 
                 G                Gsus4 |
      I'm by the window where the light is


 She's my best friend,better than a dog or car
 She's my best friend understands me when I'm fallin'
 down, down, down...Oh it hurts to be that way
 Down, down, down...

 Oh it hurts to know the bad kinda fella
 here's to Mulberry Jane...she made jam when she came
 Somebody cut off her feet,
 Now the jelly rolls in the street

    If you want to see me
    Sorry but I'm not around
    If you want to be me turn around 
    I'm by the window where the light is

 She's my best friend
 Certainly not the average girl
 She's my best friend
 Understands me when I'm fallin' (fallin')

 |G      C     G       F
  Fallin down, fallin' down
  F  G   C     G      F   |
  Fallin down, fallin down...

  Repeat to fade with ad lib shouts.
