Subject: CRD: Baby I'm in the Mood for You

                       Baby I'm in the Mood for You         Bob Dylan

from the album Biograph (previously unreleased song)

G
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna milk my milk cow low
C                                                   G
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna leave my lonesome home
G                                 B7               C
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna hit that highway road
         G         D            G     C   
But then again and again I said oh oh oh
G      D                    G
Oh Babe I'm in the mood for you

Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna turn my back to the wall
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna live in my pony stall
Sometimes I'm in the mood I ain't gonna do nothin at all
But then again and again I said oh I said oh I said
Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you

Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change the things in the town
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change the whole world around
But then again and again I said oh I said oh I said
Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you

Sometimes I'm in the mood I'm gonna give away all my sins
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna walk the road again
Sometimes I'm in the mood and I'm bound to lose again
But then again and again I said oh I said oh I said
Oh babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you


The intro if I remember is a hammering/picking thing 
between G, G6, G/B.

The harmonica part is a riot (it's the only reason I play this fairly
silly tune), if you have a G harp.
