key: C
C    C/B Am C/G F         C  C/B  Am C/G F ]
Ooh ooh ooh  a ooh a ooh, ooh ooh ooh  a ooh a ooh
C         C/B            Am        C/G        F
Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
C             C/B          Am           Am7
I've got some real-estate here in my bag
Em7                     A7              Em7          A7
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner pies
Em7   D     C      G        C  C/B Am Am7/6 F
And walked off to look for America

C       C/B         Am          C/G            F
Cathy I said as we boarded the Greyhound in Pittsburg
C        C/B            Am            Am7
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
G
It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw
Em7   D    G       D         Cmaj7 C
And I've come to look for America

Bbmaj7           Bb             C
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
Bbmaj7                                     C C/B Am C/G
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
F                      Fmaj7               C C/B Am C/G Am6 Fmaj7
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera

C         C/B         Am              C/G         F
Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in my raincoat
C              C/B          Am    Am7
We smoked the last one an hour ago
Em7                  A7      Em7             A7
So I looked at the scenery,  she read her magazine
Em7       D   C   G         C  C/B   Am C/G F 
And the moon rose over an open field

C         C/B       Am             C/G            F
Cathy I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
    C          C/B          Am           Am7
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
G
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
        D   G       D        Cmaj7
They've all come to look for America
        D   G       D        Cmaj7
They've all come to look for America
        D   G       D        Cmaj7  C
They've all come to look for America
C   C/B   Am  C/G  Dm  F G  G7
Do do do do-da-do, do do do do-da-do (repeat and fade)

NOTE:  At the end of each C C/B Am C/G F chord progression, there
is a small but important extra note.  While fingering the F chord 
(1 3 3 2 1 1), quickly hammer on and then pull off the sus note
(1 3 3 3 1 1).  Do this twice each time.
