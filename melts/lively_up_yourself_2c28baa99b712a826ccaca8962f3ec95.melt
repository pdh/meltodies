'Cause reggae is another bag


What you got that I don't know?
I'm a-trying to wonder why you act so
(Hey, do you hear what the man seh?)
Lively up your woman in the morning time, you'all
Keep a lively up your woman in the
Morning time, you'all
Keep a lively up your woman when
The evening come and take her, take ya


You rock so, you rock so
You dip so, you dip so
You skank so, you skank so
And don't be no drag
You come so, you come so
For reggae is another bag


Get what you got in that bag
What have you got in the other bag
You got hanging there?
What you say you got?
I don't believe you!
