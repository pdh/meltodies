Red Sun by Neil Young

Submitted by Martijn Soenen (martijnsoenen@hotmail.com)

I observed the Austin Texas video of Neil in 1999 good and after me there is a little riff
(actually the intro) that makes this song very beautiful. During the song it sounds very good
if you repeat the hammer-ons like the intro. Certainly during the chorus. eg. after the
"When the one who's coming arrives here at last" part.


TUNING: Dropped standard (DGCFAD). Sounds good with normal tuning as well.

VERSE:
         C       G           D        C
When the red sun sets on the Railroad town,
         D            Am7             G     C
And the bars begin to laugh with the happy sound;
               G          D       C
I'll still be here right by your side,
          D        Am7       G         C
There'll not be anyone in my heart but you.

CHORUS:
        D                          G             C
And the dreams that you have, they won't let you down,
       D           Em            C          D       C
If you just follow on 'cause you know where they're found;
    D                            G               C
The well will be flowing and the words will come fast,
         D         Em       C          D  C       PLAY INTRO HERE
When the one who's coming arrives here at last.

VERSE:
       C      G           D        C
On the grassy hill of the Railroad town,
         D          Am7             G        C
Where we cut through the fences and over the crown
       C           G             D           C
Where the wind was blowing right through your hair,
  D              Am7        G        C
I dreamt that my mommy and daddy were there.

Chorus:
        D                          G             C
And the dreams that you have, they won't let you down,
       D           Em            C          D       C
If you just follow on 'cause you know where they're found;
    D                            G               C
The well will be flowing and the words will come fast,
         D         Em       C          D  C       PLAY INTRO HERE
When the one who's coming arrives here at last.
