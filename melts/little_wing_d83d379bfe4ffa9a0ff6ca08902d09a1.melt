Intro: Cmaj7 Fmaj7 (4x)                 
                                        
Fmaj7                    Cmaj7          
All her friends call her Little Wing    
                                        
Fmaj7                           Cmaj7   
but she flies rings around them all     
                                        
Fmaj7                      Cmaj7        
she comes to town when the children sing
                                        
Fmaj7                            Cmaj7  
and leaves them feathers if they fall   
                                        
Fmaj7                           Cmaj7   
she leaves her feathers if they fall    
                                        
                                       
Little Wing don't fly away              
when the summer turns to fall           
don't you know some people say          
the winter's the best time of them all  
the winter's the best of all
