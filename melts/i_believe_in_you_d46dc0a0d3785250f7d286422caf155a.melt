E
They ask me how I feel

And if my love is real
                    A       E
And how I know I'll make it through.
                 A   E  
And they, they look at me and frown,
                                   D
They'd like to drive me from this town,
                    A
They don't want me around
             E 
'Cause I believe in you.





E
They show me to the door,

They say don't come back no more
                               A       E
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to,
               A      E
And I walk out on my own
                      D
A thousand miles from home
                   A
But I don't feel alone
            E
'Cause I believe in you.



    D             A                               E
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
    D             A                  E     Esus4 E 
I believe in you even though we be apart.
    D             A                     E
I believe in you even on the morning after.
A             B    E/G#   A
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
             B      E/G#   A
Oh, when the night is disappearing
          B           E/G#      A     B
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.



E
Don't let me drift too far,

Keep me where you are
                     A    E
Where I will always be renewed.
                A        E
And that which you've given me today
                             D 
Is worth more than I could pay
                          A
And no matter what they say
      E  
I believe in you.

     D                   A            E
I believe in you when winter turn to summer,
     D                 A              E   
I believe in you when white turn to black,

I believe in you even though I be outnumbered.
A               B     E/G#      A
Oh, though the earth may shake me

Oh, though my friends forsake me
          B     E/G#    A          B
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.








E
Don't let me change my heart,

Keep me set apart
                         A     E
From all the plans they do pursue.

And I, I don't mind the pain
                        D   
Don't mind the driving rain
                   A
I know I will sustain
             E
'Cause I believe in you.
