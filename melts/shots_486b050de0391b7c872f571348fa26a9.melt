Shots - Neil Young
tabbed by Stan Southern

Here are the chords and words to "Shots",
the Boarding House 5/27/78 version.  
This song is played in a "dropped" tuning
(DGCFAD, instead of EADGBE).  However,
the chords I have listed are those that
would be played as if there was no dropped tuning.

Thus, an Am as I have it written is really a 
Gm I guess.  But it's a lot easier to play it
in the dropped tuning.

I can't remember the name of one chord - it's A something.
I have it listed as A??, but it's really just 003210
(it's that chord from My My Hey Hey)

Thanks to Steve Vetter for motivating me to transcribe
this.

Children
                   C          G                 Am       F
Are lost in the sand clearing roads with little hands
          C                   E                Am       F
Trying to join their father's castles together again
          C         G                    Am        F 
Will they make it?  Who knows where or when
                G
Old wounds will mend 

Am                F
Shots
        C             G              Am         F
Ringing all along the borders can be heard
       C           E            Am      F 
Comin' down like a venom in the sky
                    C   G             Am        F    
Cutting through the air faster than a bird
       G
in the night
 
Am           F
Machines
    C                 G              Am         F
Are winding their way along, looking strong
         C         E             Am          F   
Building roads and bringing back loads
   C      G      Am       F
of building materials
       G
in the night


Am      F
Men
              C        G               Am         F
Are trying to move the boulders on the ground
      C                     E                   Am      F
lines between the different spots that each has found
         C            G               Am     F
but back home another scene was going down
       G
in the night

Am      F
Lust
      C                    G                Am       F
Comes creepin' through the night to feed on hearts
            C         E             Am     F
of suburban wives who learned to pretend
          C         G      Am      F
when they met their dreams end
       G
in the night


Am             G             A??
But I'll never use your love you know I'm not like that
Am             G             A??
and so if you give your heart to me
Dm           E7
I promise to you
Dm           E7
whatever we do
A??         G         C       A??      C       A??
that I will always be true


Am                 F
Children

          C         G                    Am        F

                G
Old wounds will mend
