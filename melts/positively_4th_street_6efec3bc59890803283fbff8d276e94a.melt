"Positively Fourth Street" by Bob Dylan
 
You've got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
 G             C             Cm               G
 
When I was down you just stood there grinning
 G          D      C      G             D
 
You've got a lot of nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend
  G            C                Cm                        G
 
You just want to be on the side that's winning
 G          D        C      G            D
 
All verses follow same pattern.  Cm can be played (xx1013) if desired.
