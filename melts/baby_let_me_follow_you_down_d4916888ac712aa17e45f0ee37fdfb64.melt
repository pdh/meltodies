Baby Let Me Follow You Down

standard tuning - no capo

It looks simple, but it's actually a bit tricky.  It's certainly not a slow song.
But you can watch The Last Waltz to get this down.  I've seen a variety of lyrics
and arangements of them.  I don't know if there is a straight-up version...  

chords for intro &amp; between verses   G-F-G-F-C (I play mostly top strings for the
first three and grab the complete chord for last two F &amp; C chords.)


G...                       F...
Baby let me follow you     down

C...                       Eb...
Baby let me follow you     down. Well, I'll 

G.          D.                     C.           D.
do       anything in this  God Almighty world if you'll 

C.             D.             G...
just let me follow you     down

[G]Can I come home with [F]you?
[C]Baby, can I come home with [Eb]you? Yes, I'll 
[G]do any[D]thing in this [C]God Almighty [D]world if you'll 
[C]just let me [D]come home with [G]you

[G]Baby can I follow you [F]home?
[C]Baby can I follow you [Eb]home? I'll 
[G]do any[D]thing in this [C]God Almighty [D]world if you'll 
[C]just let me [D]follow you [G]home

[G]I'd do anything for [F]you.
[C]I'd do anything in this [Eb]world for you. Well, I'll 
[G]do any[D]thing in this [C]God Almighty [D]world if you'll 
[C]just let me [D]come home with [G]you

[G]I'll buy you a diamond [F]ring.
[C]I'll buy you a wedding [Eb]gown. Well, I'll 
[G]do any[D]thing in this [C]God Almighty [D]world if you'll 
[C]just let me [D]come home with [G]you

[G]Baby let me follow you [F]down
[C]Baby let me follow you [Eb]down Well, I'll 
[G]do any[D]thing in this [C]God Almighty [D]world If you'll 
[C]just let me [D]follow you [G]down

more verses - 

I'll buy you a broken twine, just for you to climb - I'll do anything in this God
almighty world, if you just once drive me out of my mind

I'll buy you serpent skirt, I'll buy you a velvet shirt - I'll do anything in in
this god almighty world, if you just don't make me hurt

Enjoy,
