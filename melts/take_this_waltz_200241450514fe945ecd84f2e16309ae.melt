Intro: B . . |F#sus4 . . |F# . . |. . . |

         B                        G#m
Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women
          B               D#m/A#          G#m
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
          E                        F#
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
          E               E    D#m C#m B   D#7/A#
There's a tree where the doves go to die
           G#m
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
        C#m          G#7        C#m . . |. . B/D# |
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
E  B/D# C#m B
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
           D#7/G            G#m
Take this waltz, take this waltz
           C#/F                        E . . |. . . |
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws

F# . . |G#m . . |F#/A# . . |F# . . |

      B           D#m/A#       G#m
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
       B                    G#m
On a chair with a dead magazine
        E                      F#
In the cave at the tip of the lily
         E              E   D#m C#m  B   D#7/A#
In some hallways where love's never been
     G#m
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
     C#m              G#7           C#m . . |. . B/D# |
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand
E  B/D# C#m B
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
           D#7/G            G#7/F#
Take this waltz, take this waltz
           E6                  Fm7-5 . . |. . . |
Take its broken waist in your hand

Edim . . |Gdim . . |G#m . . |D# . . |
      G#m
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
          C#m                G#m
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
  E6                      B . . |. . . |F#sus4 . . |F# . . |
Dragging its tail in the sea
           B                G#m
There's a concert hall in Vienna
           B             D#m/A#    G#m
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
           E                               F#
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
              E              E  D#m C#m  B    D#7/A#
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
        G#m
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
        C#m         G#7        C#m . . |. . B/D# |
With a garland of freshly cut tears?
E  B/D# C#m B
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
           D#7/G            G#m
Take this waltz, take this waltz
           C#m                       E . . |. . . |
Take this waltz it's been dying for years

B . . |. . . |F# . . |. . . |

            B            D#m/A#        G#m
There's an attic where children are playing
            B                        G#m
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
      E                   F#
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
        E             E D#m C#m B    D#7/A#
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
         G#m
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
         C#m             G#7        C#m . . |. . B/D# |
All your sheep and your lilies of snow
E  B/D# C#m B
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
           D#7/G            G#7/F#
Take this waltz, take this waltz
                E6                     Fm7-5 . . |. . . |
With its "I'll never forget you, you know!"

Edim . . |Gdim . . |G#m . . |D# . . |
      G#m
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
          C#m                G#m
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
  E6                      B . . |. . . |F#sus4 . . |F# . . |
Dragging its tail in the sea
          B                  G#m
And I'll dance with you in Vienna
          B        D#m/A#     G#m
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
      E                   F#
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
     E           E  D#m C#m   B
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
          B                  G#m
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
           B              D#m/A#     G#m
With the photographs there, and the moss
          E                          F#
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
     E       E  D#m C#m  B    D#7/A#
My cheap violin and my cross
            G#m
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
        C#m            G#7           C#m
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
C#m B/D# E  B/D# C#m B
Oh my love, Oh my love
           D#7/G            G#m
Take this waltz, take this waltz
      C#m                           E . . |. . . |
It's yours now, it's all that there is
