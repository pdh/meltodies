Chorus:
C          F        C           F               C
Big Wheels Rollin', Big Wheels Rollin', Movin' On
C          F        C              Am
Big Wheels Rollin', Gotta keep em goin
C          F        G7        C
Big Wheels Rollin', Movin' on
V1:
C                     G                 C
The white line is the life line for the nation
  F                    G7            C
And men like Will and Sonny make it move
F                   C
Livin like a gypsy always on the go
D                                G7
Doin' what they best know how to do

C                  G            C
Jammin' gears has got to be a fever
    F               G7            C
Cuz' men become addicted to the grind  
    F                       C                  Am
It takes a special breed to be a truck drivin' man
      C              G7              C
and a steady hand to pull that load behind

Chorus:
V2:
C                  G               C
All night country music keeps em' goin'
F                  G7             C
And Will and Sonny keep on movin' on
  F                         C 
A big hot cup of coffee is waitin' up ahead
        D                           G7
And the rhythm of the highway hums along..
C                  G           C
Jammin' gears has got to be a fever
     F             G7            C
Cuz' men become addicted to the grind
    F                       C                  Am
It takes a special breed to be a truck drivin' man
       C              G7              C
And a steady hand to pull that load behind
