          / E     /         / B      / /
Like a / Bird, / on a / Wire, / /
          / E              /              / A       /
Like a / drunk, in a / Midnight / Choir. /
         / E     /                 / B      /        / E     / / /
I have / trie-, / ed - in my / way, / - to be / free, / / /
          / E  /            / B        /
Like a / fi - / sh on a / hook, /
           / A                   /                     /          /
Like a / knight in some / old fashioned / book, /
         / E       /             / B          /
I have / saved / - all my / ribbons, /
      / E       / / /
For / Thee, / / / and

  / A /        /          /               / E      / / /
If / I, /  - -if / I have / been un - / kind, / / /
        / A                 /             / B   / / /
I just / hope you will / let it go / by, / / /  and
   / A /       /           /               / E      / / /
If / I,  / - - if / I have / been un - / true, / / /
  / A            /         /           /             / B     / / /
I / hope you / know / it was / never to / you. / / /

           / E     /             / B      /
Like a / baby / - - still - / born, /
           / E      /            / A      /
Like a / beast / with his / horn, /
          / E    /         / B
I have / torn / every / one,
        / B                   / E    / / /
Who / reached out to / me, / / /

        / E      /                 / B      /
But I / swe - / ar, by this / song, / and
     / E         /                   / A        /
By / all, that / I have done / wrong, /
E /         /       /    /B        /        / E      / / /
I'll / ma - / ake / it / all up / - - to / thee. / / /

            / A                /
I saw a / young man, / leaning,
A        /              / E        / / /
On his / wooden / crutch, / / /
A             /                / / /
He called / out to me, / / /
         / A             / B           / / /
"Don't / ask for so / much.", / / / and
    / A       /             /
A / young / woman / leaning,
A         / E            /         / / /
In / her / darkened / door, / / /
               / A               / / /
She cried / out to me, / / /
          / A               / B          / / /
"Why / not ask for / more?" / / /
