VERSE:
      Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
      Can you feel the magic hangin' in the air?
      Can you feel the magic? Oh, yeah

CHORUS:
       F         C      F          C           F  C
      Love is a mystery I can't demystify, oh, no
    Bb                                  C
      And sometimes I wonder why we're here
          F        Bb            C    F  C 
      But I don't care, I don't care

VERSE:
      When I hear the drummer, get me in the groove
      When I hear the guitar, makes me wanna move
      Can you feel the magic, floatin' in the air?
      Can you feel the magic? Oh yeah

CHORUS:
      Sometimes you're feelin' you've been pushed around
      And your rainbow justain't here
      Don't you fear, don't you fear

VERSE:
      When you hear the music trouble disappears
      When you hear the music ringin' in your ears
      Can you feel the magic floatin' in the air?
      Can you hear the magic? Oh yeah


INSTRUMENTAL:  PLAY CHORDS TO CHORUS --  THEN INTRO -- 5x's


VERSE:
      Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
      Can you feel the magic dancin' in the air?
      Can you feel the magic? Oh yeah

CHORUS:
      Love is a mystery I can't demystify, oh no
      Sometimes I'm dancin' on air
      But I get scared, I get scared

VERSE:
      Can you hear the music? Oh yeah
      Can you hear the music ringin' in my ear?
      Can you hear the music, can you hear the music?
