Hank Williams    Jambalaya

C                                  G
Goodbye, joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh.
                                       C
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou.
                                  G
My yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh.
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
                                             G      
Well jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
                                      C     
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
                                    G      
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

C                                    G
Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin',
                                  C
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen.
                                         G
We dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh.
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
                                             G      
Well jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
                                      C     
Cause tonight i'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
                                   G       
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

                                       C     
Cause tonight i'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
                                    G
