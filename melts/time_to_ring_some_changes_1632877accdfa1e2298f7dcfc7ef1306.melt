Time To Ring Some Changes  

E                   A        E
This old house is a tumbling down
                          B        E
The walls are gone but the roof is sound
                            A        E
The landlord’s deaf, he can never be found
                       B   E
It’s time to ring some changes

They’ll arrest you son if you just stand still
They’ll ask you to pose with your hand in the till
They’ll ask you to die when you’ve written your will
It’s time to ring some changes

A                          E                 B   E
Time to ring some changes, time to ring some changes
A                          E                 B   E
Time to ring some changes, time to ring some changes

You earn your money for your daily bread
But the bread’s gone up so you need more money
But the money’s gone down, better borrow instead
It’s time to ring some changes

Now the politicians, they look so smug
They say tell the truth, then they give you a shrug
You might find the truth swept under the rug
It’s time to ring some changes

Time to ring some changes, time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes, time to ring some changes

Now listen here to the self-made man
He says why can’t you if I can
Can’t you push buttons, can’t you make plans
It’s time to ring some changes

I’m going to tear this mansion down
Get my feet back on the ground
Penny for penny and pound for pound
It’s time to ring some changes

Time to ring some changes, time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes...
