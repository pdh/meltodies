Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian- John Prine
[C]I packed my bags and bought myself a ticket
For the land of the tall palm [G]tree
Aloha Old Milwaukee, Hello Waiki[C]ki
I just stepped down from the airplane
When I thought I heard her [F]say
Waka waka nuka nuka, [C]waka waka nuka nuka
[G]Would you like a [C]lei?  [G]Eh?
 
Chorus:
[C]Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian.
Whisper in my [G]ear
Kicka poo ka maka wa wah wahini
Are the words I long to [C]hear
Lay your coconut on my tiki.  
What the hecka mooka mooka [F]dear
Let's talk dirty in Ha[C]waiian [A]
Say the [D]words I [G]long to [C]hear
 
[F]   [C]   [A]   [D]   [G]   [C]
 
[C]It's a ukelele Honolulu sunset
Listen to the grass skirts [G]sway
Drinking rum from a pineapple
Out on Honolulu [C]Bay
The steel guitars all playing
While she's talking with her [F]hands
Gimme gimme oka doka [C]make a wish and wanta polka
[G]Words I under[C]stand [G]
 
[Chorus]
 
[C]I boughta lota junka with my moola
And sent it to the folks back [G]home
I never had the chance to dance the hula
I guess I should have [C]known
When you start talking to the sweet wahini
Walking in the pale moon[F]light
Oka doka what a setta [C]knocka rocka sis boom bocas
[G]Hope I said it [C]right [G]
 
Chorus                     …….Aloha
