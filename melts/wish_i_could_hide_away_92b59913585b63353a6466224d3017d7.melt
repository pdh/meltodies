Gm            F
Howdy, friend, beggin' your pardon,
C                          G
Is there somethin' on your mind?
Gm                  F
You've gone and sold all your belongings,
C                         G
Is that something in your eye?

        Bm              C
Well, I know you really never
          G               C
Liked the way it all goes down;
Bm     D     G
Go on, hide away.

Gm     
What's that you say?
          F
We're all bound for the graveyard;
C                G
Oooh, I wish you well.
Gm         
Think it's gonna rain,
F
Oh, what's the diff'rence,
C                       G
Is there some way I can help?

           Bm              C
'Cause you know, I'm gonna miss you
            G         C
When you're gone, oh, Lord,
Bm           D     G
Wish I Could hide away

C    D   Em       Bm     C      Am
Hold on, give yourself a chance,
      C                G
I can hear the leavin' train.

Gm         F
All aboard! Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!
C                G
Oooh, I wish you well.
Gm           F
See you soon, maybe tomorrow.
C             G
You can never tell;

           Bm              C
'Cause you know, I'm gonna miss you
            G         C
When you're gone, oh, Lord,
Bm           D     G
Wish I Could hide away

      C          G          C          G 
Hide away, hide away, hide away, hide away, 
      C          G          C          G 
hide away, hide away, hide away, hide away.. 

C G  2x
