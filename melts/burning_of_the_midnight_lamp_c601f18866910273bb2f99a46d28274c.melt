:Intro Riff: 


F                    Dm  
The morning is dead and the day is too
Bm                                     E 
There's nothing left here to lead me, but the velvet moon
C                  G
All my loneliness I have felt today
D                              F                            F#
It's a little more than enough to make a man throw himself away
G             F F# G                        F F# G
And I continue    to burn the Midnight Lamp,    alone 

:Intro Riff:

F
Now the smiling portrait of you
Dm
Is still hanging on my frowning wall
Bm                                               E
It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me   too much at all
C                                 G
It's just the uh ever falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
D               
That forgotten earring laying on the floor
F                           F#
Facing coldly towards the door
G             F F# G                         F F#  G
And I continue      to burn the Midnight Lamp,     all alone   Burn!

:F----F#- G----:

Yeah, yeah Lonely, lonely, lonely

G----
Loneliness is such a drag

:Intro Riff:

F                     Dm
So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Bm
Getting ready for the same old explosion
E
Going through my mind
C
And soon enough the time will tell
G
About the circus in the wishing well
D
And someone who will buy and sell for me
F                          F#
Someone who will toll my bell
G              F F#  G                          F F# G
And I continue        to burn the same old lamp,     alone

G-----F F# G------- F F# G-------

Yeah   Darling, can you hear me calling you?
So lonely
Gotta blow my mind
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely . . .
