Verse:
         C       G           D        C  
When the red sun sets on the Railroad town,
         D            Am7             G     C
And the bars begin to laugh with the happy sound;
               G          D       C
I'll still be here right by your side,
          D        Am7       G         C
There'll not be anyone in my heart but you.

Chorus:
        D                          G             C
And the dreams that you have, they won't let you down,
       D           Em            C          D       C
If you just follow on 'cause you know where they're found;
    D                            G               C
The well will be flowing and the words will come fast,
         D         Em       C          D  C    C   D/F#
When the one who's coming arrives here at last.

Verse:
On the grassy hill of the Railroad town,
Where we cut through the fences and over the crown;
Where the wind was blowing right through your hair,
I dreamt that my mommy and daddy were there.

(Repeat Chorus)

When the red sun sets on the Railroad town,
And the bars begin to laugh with the happy sound;
I'll still be here right by your side,
There'll not be another in my heart but you.
