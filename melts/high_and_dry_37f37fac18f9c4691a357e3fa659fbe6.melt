F                      Bb              F
High and dry well, I'm up here with no warning 
F                    Bb             C
High and dry well, I couldn't get a word in 
F                Gm7           F
High and dry oh, what a way to go 
Gm7                  C                  F
She left me standing here just high and dry 
F                       Bb              F
A minute I was up there standing by her side
F                                Bb              C 
The next I was down there, well, left out of the ride and 
F                Gm7           F
High and dry oh, what a way to go 
Gm7                  C                  F
She left me standing here just high and dry 
F                       Bb          F
Anything I wished for I only had to ask her 
F                            Bb          C
I think she found out it was money I was after 
F                Gm7             F
High and dry oh, what a weird letdown 
Gm7                  C                  F
She left me standing here just high and dry 
F                             Bb         F
It's lucky that I didn't have any love towards her 
F                                 Bb                C
Next time I'll make sure that the girl will be much poorer
F                Gm7           F 
High and dry oh, what a way to go 
Gm7                  C                  F
She left me standing here just high and dry
F                      Bb              F 
High and dry well, I'm up here with no warning
F                    Bb             C
High and dry well, I couldn't get a word in
F                Gm7           F 
High and dry oh, what a way to go 
Gm7                  C                  F
She left me standing here just high and dry 
Gm7                        C                  F                             
Well, she left me standing here just high and dry 
Gm7                        C                  F
Well, she left me standing here just high and dry
