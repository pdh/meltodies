Tuning: standard

Here's a tabulature with the bass tones written out as well so you can do it all on 
I was inspired by Otis Reddings' version of the song. I know
it's frowned upon to have a version that's not ear-transcribed but I thought I'd 
this version. Since there are like 100,000 different versions
of this song out there it's not weird for me to have transcribed this version to my 
If you want to use this tab for playing along you could tune the guitar down 3 steps (to C#).

Otis version uses the Chords: A - F#m - D - E - A
But I think it's more comfortable to sing and play it when transcribed to:
C - Am - F - G - C

So here it is then.
Where I wrote the X's I usually just tap the strings with my right hand to resemble the 
in Otis' version. It's not required but I find it adds some character to the song. =)

It's the same chords for the chorus as for the verse. Here's the lyrics with the chords 
it may or may not be of help to you.

          C                Am
When the night has come

And the land is dark
         F            G               C
And the moon is the only light we'll see
      C                     Am
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
         F            G          C
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

C                                              Am
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
        F     G             C
Oh now stand,   stand by me,   stand by me.

        C                     Am
If the sky that we look upon

Should tumble and fall
          F                G             C
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
         C                      Am
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
         F            G          C
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

C                                              Am
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
        F     G             C
Oh now stand,   stand by me,   stand by me.


C                                                              Am
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh now now stand by me
        F     G             C
Oh now stand,   stand by me,   stand by me.

C                                              Am
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
        F     G             C
Oh now stand,   stand by me,   stand by me.
