Notes:
1. Part of the 'slack-key guitar' sound is related to it being tuned a half-step down.  
It's also easier to play the octave chords (*).
2. Another wonderful piece of diverse musical creation from Dylan and Hildago.  Replete 
with hallmarks of Charlie Christian, Folk, Washboard Skiffle to Tex-Mex drum rolls. 
Early rock and improvised Jazz guitar accents.
3. The Lead Guitar accents are most prominent and varied in the later verses and the 
Bass Lines are typical Walkin' Blues runs.  They are worthy of separate annotation.
