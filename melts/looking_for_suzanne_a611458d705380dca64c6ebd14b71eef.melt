***************** LOOKING FOR SUZANNE ****************

performed by Waylon Jennings.


Verse 1:
         D
	In my darkest hour,woke up to a storm
       G                        D
	I turned to hold my baby,but she was gone

	I looked all around me,calling her name
       G                            D
	No letter,no word of goodbye,walked out in the rain
         G             D
	Looking for Suzanne


Verse 2:
         D
	Strangest of notions,chilled me to the bone
       G                               D
	Something whispered in the wind,she ain't coming home
         G             D     G             D
	Looking for Suzanne,looking for Suzanne


Bridge:
         G
	Suzanne went away,as i think about it today
       A              D                G                   D
	As hard as i try i can't understand,looking for Suzanne


Verse 3:
         D
	Each walking moment,each sleepless night
       G                                D
	I search for the one that i love,the rest of my life
         G             D
	Looking for Suzanne

         G             D
	Looking for Suzanne (til end ...)
