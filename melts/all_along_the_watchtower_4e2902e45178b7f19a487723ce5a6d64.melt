Intro- Am G F G Am (Quick Transtion Through G to Am)
Am            G         F           G-Am
There must be some way out of here
Am       G         F         G-Am
Said the joker to the theif
Am          G       F      G-Am
There's too much confusion
Am       G        F     G-Am
I can't get no relief
Am       G         F            G-Am
Business men they drink my wine
Am       G     F      G-Am
Plowmen dig my earth
Am       G       F             G-Am
But none of them along the line
Am      G       F    G-Am
Nobody of it is worth

Am G F G Am x 2

Am        G       F    G-Am
No reason to get exited
Am        G       F      G-Am
The thief he kindly spoke
Am      G       F           G-Am
There are many here among us
Am            G       F         G-Am
Who feel that life is but a joke
Am          G       F                G-Am
But you and I we've been through that
Am       G       F       G-Am
And this is not our fate
Am        G       F           G-Am
So let us not talk falsely now
Am      G       F       G-Am
The hour's getting late

Am G F G Am x2

Am      G       F       G-Am
All along the watchtower
Am      G        F       G-Am
The princes kept the view
Am         G        F            G-Am
While all the women came and went, 
Am      G       F       G-Am
bear foot servants, too.
Am      G       F      G-Am
Outside in the distance
Am      G       F    G-Am
A wild cat did growl
Am      G       F          G-Am
Two riders were approaching
Am      G         F    G-Am
The wind began to howl
