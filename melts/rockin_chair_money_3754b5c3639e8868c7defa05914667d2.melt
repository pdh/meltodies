E
Now I got rockin' chair money
E
But I got it the hard, hard way
  A               E
I fought in every battle
E
From the start to the VJ day
             E
And now I'll rock, yeah rock
        B7                     E
Oh baby rock, rock on down the line


E
Now some folks seem to be jealous
E
Some don't seem to care
    A                   E
But I got rockin' chair money, honey
E
To rock on away from here
                E
Cause I love to rock, yeah rock
      B7                     E
Baby, rock, rock on down the line


E
I rocked away out on the ocean
E
I rocked from here and there
   A                      E
My baby stepped out while I was gone
E
Now she don't get my rockin' chair
                E
Cause I love to rock, yeah rock
      B7                     E
Baby, rock, rock on down the line


E
I'll soon get my big check, baby
E
And then we'll have some fun
     A                    E
This rockin' chair money, honey
E
Is better than totin' a gun
                E
Cause I love to rock, yeah rock
      B7
Baby, rock, let's rock on down the line


E
Now, honey, let's go honky tonkin'
E
Let's honky tonk all night
      A            E          
Let's lollygag and smooch and love
E
and do it all up right
                E
Cause I love to rock, yeah rock
      B7                           E
Baby, rock, let's rock on down the line
