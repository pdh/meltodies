Intro: Am

Am

Well,It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
A
If you don't know by now 
Am
And It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
A
It will never do anyhow
E
When your roosters a crowin at the break of dawn
A
Look out your window and I'll be gone 
Am
You're the reason why I'm trav'lin' on
A
But,Don't think twice, it's all right
Am
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe 
A
The light I never knowed 
Am                                       D
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
A
I'm on the dark side of the road
Am
But I wish there was somethin' I could do or say
A
To try and make you change your mind and stay
Am
We never did too much talkin' anyway 
A
But don't think twice, it's all right 
E
Well,It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal


A
Like you never done before
Am
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
A
I can't hear you any more
Am
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin down the road 
A
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
E
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
Am
But don't think twice, it's all right
E
So long honey babe
A
Where I'm bound,I can not tell
Am
But goodbye's too good a word, gal 
A
So I'll just kinda say fare thee well
Am
Now I'm not sayin' that you treated me unkind
A
You could have done alot better but I don't mind 
E
You just kinda wasted my precious time
A
But don't think twice, it's all right 







Pretty simple chords, eh? You might want to listen to Cash's version to get the rythm of it.

Sorry, If I'm wrong. I haven't heard the full Cash song.


Overall, enjoy!
