Irma Jackson 
 
C
I'd love to shout my feelin's from a mountain high
                                  G7 
Tell the world I love her and I will till I die
There's no way the world will understand that love is colour blind
                                 C
That's why Irma Jackson can't be mine

I remember when no one cared about us bein' friends
We were only children and it really didn't matter then
But we grew up too quickly in a world that draws a line
Where they say Irma Jackson can't be mine

Chorus:
      F
If my lovin' Irma Jackson is a sin
                                     G7 
Then I don't understand this crazy world we're livin' in
There's a muddy wall between us standin' high
                                  C
But I'll love Irma Jackson till I die

She tells me she's decided that she'll go away
And I guess it's right but she alone should have the final say
But in spite of her decision forcin' us to say goodbye
I'll still love Irma Jackson till I die

Chorus
