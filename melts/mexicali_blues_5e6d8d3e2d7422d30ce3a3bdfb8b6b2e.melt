Also, many thanks for maintaining OLGA.  I've used it many times.  This 
is my first submission and I hope to send more.

Mexicali Blues, Grateful Dead

A                                   G    B     Em
Layin' back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
A                                  D
Watchin' flies and children on the street
      A                                       G      B      Em
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
          A                                D
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet

         G                    B                 Em
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
  A                                D
I guess I came to keep from payin' dues
    G                  B            Em
But instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
      A
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

D
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
                        A
When the devil wants to take it all away?

Cherish well your thoughts, keep a tight grip on your booze
                               G(open)      A
'Cuz thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today.

A                                  G       B        Em
She said her name was Billie Jean; she was fresh in town
  A                                 D
I didn't know a stage line ran from hell
        A                              G        B
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
A                                    D
All the french perfume you'd care to smell

    G            B               Em
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
   A                            D
Go on my friend do anything you choose.
        G                B             Em
Now I'm paying for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
       A                                    D
With a lifetime case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah.

A                               G          B       Em
Then a man rode into town; some thought he was the law
A                               D
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
    A                              G      B      Em
She told me he would take her if I didn't use my gun
    A                             D
And I'd have no one but myself to blame

  G                  B              Em
I went down to those dusty streets; blood was on my mind
  A                                    D
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news.
     G                B                    Em
"Cuz I shot first and killed him.  Lord he didn't even draw.
       A                                                D
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues.

D
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
                     A
When he lets a woman hold him in her hand?

You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
                         G(open)            A
Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands.


Notes:

I use a strum with a lot of alternating bass - usually 4th and 5th strings -
for the A and D chords.  However, I find that the strumming patterns
vary greatly throughout the song.  Play along with the record to get
the right feel.

I fake the trumpet intro with D chord forms using D, Dsus4 and D9.

The G-B-Em chord progression in some verses sounds best as single emphasized 
strums synchronized to the words (e.g. some THOUGHT he WAS the LAW).
