All My Love
Led Zeppelin

INTRO:
| Am  G  | Dm    | Am  G  | D     |
                   (drums+bass enter)
| Am  G  | Dm    | Am  G  | D     |


VERSE 1:
| Am              G                  | Dm               |
    Should I fall out of love, my      fire in the light
| Am              G                  | D                |
    To chase a    feather in the       wind
| Am              G                  | Dm               |
    Within the    glow that weaves the cloak of delight
| Am              G                  | D                |
    There moves a thread that has no   end

VERSE 2:
| Am               G                 | Dm               |
      For many     hours and days that passes ever soon
| Am               G                 | D                |
    The tides have caused the          flame to dim
| Am               G                 | Dm               |
    At last the   arm is straight, the hand to the loom
| Am               G                 | D                |
      Is this to   end or just       begin?

CHORUS:
| C               | G/B            |
  All of my love    All of my love
| Am        G     | F              |
  All of my love to you
| C               | G/B            |
  All of my love    All of my love
| Am        G     | F              |
  All of my love to you

VERSE 3:
| Am             G                  | Dm                |
    The cup is   raised, the toast is made yet again
| Am             G                  | D                 |
    One voice is clear above the      din
| Am             G                  | Dm                |
        Proud Arianne one word,    my will to sustain
| Am             G                  | D                 |
    For me the   cloth  once more  to spin

VERSE 4:
| Am             G                 | Dm                 |
    Yours is the cloth, mine is the  hand that sews time
| Am             G                 | D                  |
    His is the   force that lies within
| Am             G                 | Dm                 |
    Ours is the  fire, all the       warmth we can find
| Am             G                 | D                  |
    He is the    feather in the      wind

  All of my love to you
