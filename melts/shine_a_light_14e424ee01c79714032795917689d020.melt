  C                         Cmaj9
Saw you stretched out, in room ten o-nine, 
Am                               G
With a smile on your face, and a tear right in your eye
    F                      C
Oh, couldn't see, to get a light on you
G        F          C
My sweet honey love
C               Cmaj9
Berber jewelry, jangling down the street,
Am                               G
Make you shut your eyes at every woman that you meet
F                       C
Couldn't seem, to get a high on you
G        F          C
My sweet honey love
        C                  G
Chorus: May the good Lord, shine a light on you
        F                         C
        Make every song you sing, your favorite tune
        C                  G
        May the good lord, shine a light on you
        F                      C
        Warm, like the evening sun
C
Well you're drunk, in the alley baby 
Cmaj9
With your clothes all torn
         Am
And your late night friends have leaved you
       G
On the cold gray dawn
F                     C
Just seemed too many, flies on you
G      F                 C
I just can't, brush them off
C                         Cmaj9
Angels beating, all their wings in time
Am                           G
Smiles on their faces, and a gleam right in their eyes
    F                    C
Oh, thought I heard one, sigh for you
G               F
Come on up now, come on up now,
C               G
Come on up now, come on up now,

[Repeat chorus until the end]

For the solo's, just play play the chorus over the notes.

Well, that's pretty much it. My first submission, so rate and comment with any corrections.
