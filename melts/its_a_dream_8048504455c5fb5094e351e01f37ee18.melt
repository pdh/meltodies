Tabbed by: G. S. Saavedra II


C FM7 (2x)


        C                         FM7
In the morning when I wake up and listen to the sound
        C                   FM7   G
Of the birds outside on the roof
   C                     FM7
I try to ignore what the paper says
       C                      FM7   G
And I try not to read all the news
          C                    FM7
And I'll hold you if you had a bad dream
       C                   FM7   G
And I hope it never comes true
       C                               FM7
'Cause you and I been through so many things together
        C                        FM7    G
And the sun starts climbing the roof


Chorus I:

        C
It's a dream
        G
Only a dream
         FM7          G
And it's fading now
        C
Fading away
             G
It's only a dream
       FM7                G        C
Just a memory without anywhere to stay

        C                             FM7
The Red River stills flows through my home town
C                           FM7   G
Rollin' and tumblin' on its way
 C                             FM7
Swirling around the old bridge pylons
        C                       FM7   G
Where a boy fishes the morning away
    C                   FM7
His bicycle leans on an oak tree
           C                 FM7   G
While the cars cross by overhead
    C                             FM7
An aeroplane leaves a trail in an empty blue sky
         C                         FM7   G
And the young birds call out to be fed


Repeat Chorus I -----

    C                         FM7
An old man walks along on the sidewalk
C                             FM7   G
Sunglasses and an old Stetson hat 
     C                              FM7
The four winds blow the back of his overcoat away
       C                          FM7    G
As he stops with the policeman to chat
       C                     FM7
And a train rolls out of the station
          C                      FM7   G
That was really somethin' in its day
C                        FM7
Picking up speed on the straight prairie rails
       C                      FM7   G
As it carries the passengers away


Chorus II:

          C
And it's gone
        G
Only a dream
         FM7         G
And it's fading now
        C
Fading away
        G
Only a dream
       FM7                G        C
Just a memory without anywhere to stay
