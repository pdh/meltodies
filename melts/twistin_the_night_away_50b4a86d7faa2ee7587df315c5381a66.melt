Let me tell ya 'bout the place,
Em
Somewhere up New York ways

where the people are so gay,

Twisting the night away
G
Here they have a lot of fun,
Em
Putting trouble on the run
C
Man there ain't nothing like,
D7                   G
Twisting the night a-way

G
Twisting, Twisting 
Everybody's doing great
C 
Twisting, twisting 
        D7                   G
They're twisting the night a-way

G
Here's a fella in blue jeans,
Em
He's dancing with an older queen
C
Chick's dolled up in diamond ring,
D7
Twisting the night away

G
Man you gotta see her go,
Em
Twisting to the rock'n'roll
C
Man, there ain't nothing like,
D7                   G
Twisting the night a-way

Twisting, Twisting 
Everybody's doing great

Here's a man in evening clothes,
Em
How he got here I don't know

This chick's moving up and back

Twisting the night a-way!

Twisting, Twisting 
Everybody's doing great
