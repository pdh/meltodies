N.C.

Dm  |  Dm

VERSE ONE

Dm		           A
   I see a red door and I want it painted black
Dm		           A
   No colours anymore I want them to turn black

CHROUS ONE

F    C	      F	         C	    Dm
   I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
F    C        F	      C      G	             A
   I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

VERSE TWO

Dm			     A
   I see a line of cars and they’re all painted black
Dm			          A
   With flowers and my love both never to come back



CHROUS TWO

F    C           F	    C	      Dm
   I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
F          C	   F    C        G	       A
   Like a new born baby it just happens every day

  I see my red door and I want it painted black

CHROUS THREE

   Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
F           C      F    C	 G		    A
   It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

VERSE FOUR

Dm				A
  No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
Dm			          A
  I could not foresee this thing happening to you

CHROUS FOUR

  If I look hard enough in to the setting sun
F       C              F	     C        G		       A
  My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

OUTRO

Dm						       A	
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Dm						       A
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
	        Dm
I wanna see it painted, painted black
A
Black as night, black as coal
   Dm		            A
I wanna see the sun blotted out in the sun
	       Dm
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted
         A
Painted black,   yeah!
Dm					     A
