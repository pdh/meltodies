As Long As The Grass Shall Grow
The Unearthed Version
No capo.

(A)Imet you in the sshadows,and your(D)face was all aglow
I re(E)member it so well, though it was(A)many years ago
We(A)knew somethin happened,with(D)out alot to say
But we(E)had different lives,and so we(A)went our separate ways
(Aour hearts communicated(D)and everytime we passed
(E)we were gradually building something that(A)would forever last

CHORUS:(A)As long, as the(E)moon shall(A)rise
       (A)As long, as the(E)rivers?(A)flow
       As(D)long, as the sun will shine(A)
       As(D)long, as the grass shall(A)grow

My heart was callin for you, then one night you came along
We danced around eachother, then we sang our song
Our harmony was shaky,and the pitch not very true
Then you gave into me, an I gave into you
e had to fight the world, and fought with all we had
We vowed to be together, thru the sweet times and the bad

(CHORUS)

I hear you whisper every night, may i have this dance
though Im not light on my feet,I always take a chance
We gone thru many storms,an often walked thru fire
but always our love an faith, took us higher and higher
we dont know mystery of life, its love hard strong
i love you, and i always will as long

(CHORUS)
