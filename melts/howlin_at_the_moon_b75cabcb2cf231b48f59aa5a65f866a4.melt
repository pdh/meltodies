I know there's never been a man in the awful shape I'm in
             D                E               A
I can't even spell my name my heads in such a spin
D                                                 G
Today I tried to eat a steak with a big old table spoon
           G              D                      A             D
You got me chasin rabbits walkin on my hands and howlin at the moon


     D                                                 G
Well Sug I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad
                D                  E              A
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had
D                                                  G
Now I can't tell the day from night I'm crazy as a loon
           G              D                      A             D
You got me chasin rabbits pullin out my hair and howlin at the moon

Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin spree
                             D                      E               A
Cause there ain't a hounddog in this state that can hold a light to me
  D                                                  G
I ate three bones for dinner today I tried to tree a coon
           G              D                  A             D
You got me chasin rabbits cratchin fleas and howlin at the moon



(Repeat Break)



  D                                                 G
I rode my horse to town today and a gas pump we did pass
                      D                        E                A
I pulled him up and I hollered whoa and I said fill him up with gas
    D                                                    G
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham he changed my tune
           G               D                     A             D
You got me chasin rabbitts spittin out teeth and howlin at the moon


  D                                                    G
I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard
               D                     E               A
But honey baby when I fell the whole world must have jarred
D                                                        G
I think I'd quit my doggish ways if I'd take me for your goom
           G               D                    A             D
You got me chasin rabbitts pickin out rings and howlin at the moon
