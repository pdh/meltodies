Box Of Rain chords
Grateful Dead

A Asus4 4x

D           Am
Look out of any window
Em           C                Em
Any morning, any evening, any day

D         Am
Maybe the sun is shining
Em                    G                      Em
Birds are winging, no rain is falling from a heavy sky

D           G                 Am            Em      D
What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
    C             D                     Am              D
For this is all a dream we dreamed, one afternoon long ago

D           Am
Walk out of any doorway
Em             C                            G
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before

D            Am
Maybe you'll find direction
 Em
Around some corner where
G                    A
It's been waiting to meet you

D           G
What do you want me to do?
   Am                         Em        D
To watch for you while you're sleeeeeeeeping?
     Am                 C               G                D
Then please don't be surprised when you find me dreaming too.

Solo

D         Am
Look into any eyes
Em               C                            G
You find by you, you can see clear to another day

D          Am                  Em
Maybe been seen before through other eyes
   G                      A
On other days while going home

D           G                 Am             Em      D
What do you want me to do, to do for you, to see you through?
     C              Em                 D            G
It's all a dream we dreamed, one after-noon, long a-go


D         Am                   Em
Walk into splintered sunlight, inch your way through
C                      G
Dead dreams to another land

D            Am                     Em
Maybe you're tired and broken, your tongue is twisted with
G                     A
Words half-spoken and thoughts unclear

D           G                 Am             Em      D
What do you want me to do, to do for you, to see you through?
  Am               C                  G                 D
A box of rain will ease the pain, and love will see you through.

G                   Am       Em
Just a box of rain, wind and water
  C               A               D                   G D
Believe it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on.

G               Am       Em
Sun and shower, wind and rain
C              D              Em            A
In and out the window, like a moth before a flame

         D             Em
And it's just a box of rain
        G               D
I don't know who put it there;
                  Bm          G               A
Believe it if you need it, or leave it if you dare.

         D             Em
And it's just a box of rain
     G               D
Or a ribbon for your hair
       Em                 G
Such a long, long time to be gone
      Em               D    C G D
And a short time to be there.
