Ddim(xx0101)

G           G    C       Em      Am7               B    B7 C
 Here is my Song For The Asking. Ask me and I will play so sweetly,
     G               D7 G
I'll make you smile.

G           G    C       Em      Am7                   B   B7
 This is my tune for the taking. Take it, don't turn away. I've been
C       G      C     D7 G
waiting all my life.

 Em                          Bm B Dmin                     Am
 Thinking it over, I've been sad. Thinking it over, I'd be more than
D7      G           G7 C       Em      Am7               B    B7
glad to change my ways for the asking. Ask me and I will play all the
C           G      C     G D7 G
love that I hold inside.

 If anybody has the tabs for this song, I would appreciate it if you would
email to me.
