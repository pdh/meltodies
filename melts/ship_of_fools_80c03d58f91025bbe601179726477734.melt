Ship of Fools (Robert Hunter-Jerome Garcia(rest easy jerry))
-------------

[NOTE:  CAN (AND FOR AUTHENTICITY SHOULD) BE PLAYED A WHOLE STEP DOWN BY
SUITABLE TRANSPOSITION TO THE APPROPRIATE BAR CHORDS (C--&gt;Bb, G--&gt;F, etc.) --
BELOW IS THE MOST CONVENIENT OPEN CHORD RENDITION FOR ACOUSTIC GUITAR.]

IMPORTANT NOTE:  I don't know the name of the chord labeled "?" below; it is
played:  low E, A - not played
                       D - 1st fret
                       G - 2nd fret
             B - 1st fret
                high E - 2nd fret
(It's like a DM7 but with a D# replacing the fundamental on the D string; it
can also be played
by moving up the neck so that the D and B string are played on the 4th, 7th,
or 10th fret,
keeping the same relative structure.)


C                      G    F   ?                       C
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find,

C         EM7   F      Em    Dm              G
laid my proposition down, laid it on the line --

G                       F          C     Em                       Dm
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels,
            
                  (optional)
F                (D)      C                        G        F            C
but I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of  fools.


C          G   F                C
Ship of  fools on a cruel sea,

C         G  F                        Am
ship of  fools sail away from me.

Am                                  ?
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,

          F                        G          F          C       Take your pick;
         G                         F                      C        the boys
have played it at least these two ways
now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.


(same chord structure as above for the rest of the song)

Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rockin' of the boat,

and all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float.

I won't leave you drifting down, but oh it makes me wild,

thirty years upon my head to have you call me child.


Ship of fools on a cruel sea,

ship of fools sail away from me.


It was later than I thought when I first believed you,

now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.


The bottle stands as empty, as it was filled before.

Time there was and plenty, but from that cup no more

Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few

Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.


Ship of fools on a cruel sea,

ship of fools sail away from me.
