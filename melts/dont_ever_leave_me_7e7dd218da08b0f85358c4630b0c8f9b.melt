[intro]

D              D       F#               F#
Wake up every morning, heart's full of pain
G              G                E                E
Looked out the window, and it's pouring down the rain

          D    D   B7    B7
And I cry, "baby, oh, baby
E            A7          D   D
  Don't ever leave me again"

I miss your lovin', your kisses too
Ain't nothin' on earth I wouldn't do for you

          D    D   B7    B7
And I cry, "baby, oh, baby
E            A7          D   D7
  Don't ever leave me again"

G      G           G     G
  When rain starts falling
E7    E7      E7    E7
  And I start calling
D     D          D      D
  Oh baby, how I love you
A             A         A#        A#
  My heart is cryin', I feel like dyin'

Baby you know, I want you so
Tell me that your mine till the end of time

          D    D   B7    B7
And I cry, "baby, oh, baby
E            A7          D   B7
  Don't ever leave me again
E            A7          D   D7
  Don't ever leave me again"

When rain starts falling
And I start calling
Oh baby, how I love you
My heart is cryin', I feel like dyin'

Baby ya know, I want you so
Tell me that your mine till the end of time

          D    D   B7    B7
And I cry, "baby, oh, baby
E            A7          D    B7
  Don't ever leave me again, no
E            A7          D
  Don't ever leave me again"
