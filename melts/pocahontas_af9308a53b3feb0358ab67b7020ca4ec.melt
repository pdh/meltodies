A
Aurora borealis
A
The icy sky at night
Bm
Paddles cut the water
A
In a long and hurried flight
         E         G
From the white man
       D         A
to the fields of green
        E        G
And the homeland
      D     A
we've never seen.

A
They killed us in our teepees
A
And they cut our women down
Bm
They might have left some babies
A
Cryin' on the ground
        E           G
But the firesticks
        D      A
and the wagons come
        E           G
And the night falls
       D       A
on the setting sun.

A
They massacred the buffalo
A
Kitty corner from the bank
Bm
The taxis run across my feet
A
And my eyes have turned to blanks
      E          G
In my little box
       D          A
at the top of the stairs
        E          G
With my Indian rug
      D       A
and a pipe to share.

A
I wish a was a trapper
A
I would give thousand pelts
Bm
To sleep with Pocahontas
A
And find out how she felt
       E       G
In the morning
       D         A
on the fields of green
       E        G 
In the homeland
      D     A
we've never seen.

A
And maybe Marlon Brando
A
Will be there by the fire
Bm
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
A
And the good things there for hire
        E         G
And the Astrodome
        D     A 
and the first teepee
       E      G
Marlon Brando, 
    D          A
Pocahontas and me
       E      G
Marlon Brando, 
    D          A
Pocahontas and me
    E      G     D  A
Pocahontas.
