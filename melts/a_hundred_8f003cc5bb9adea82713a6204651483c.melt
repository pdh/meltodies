                           A Hundred And Sixty Acres

        G
I got a hundred and sixty acres in the valley
                                      D
Got a hundred and sixty acres of the best
        G                        C
Got an old stove there that'll cook three square
       D                               G
And a bunk where I can lay me down to rest.


       C                 G
Up at dawn to greet the sun
         D                           G
I've forgotten what a care or worry means
          C                 G
Head for home when day is done
          A                          D
With my pocket money jinglin' in my jeans.

     
            G
I've got a hundred and sixty acres full of sunshine
                                        D
Got a hundred and sixty million stars above
        G                       C
Got an old paint hoss, I'm the guy who's boss
        D                              G
On the hundred and sixty acres that I love!


       C                 G
Up at dawn to greet the sun
         D                           G
I've forgotten what a care or worry means
          C                 G
Head for home when day is done
          A                          D
With my pocket money jinglin' in my jeans.
