LOOKS LIKE RAIN
by the Grateful Dead

Transcription notes:
-&gt;    Walk down to (A Gm F#m)
~&gt;    Slide to (4nd fret to 9th fret)

E             A    -&gt;          F#m
I woke today, felt your side of bed,
E                     B                     C#m ~&gt; F#m E
The covers were still warm where you'd been laying.
E        C#m Dmaj9  A            -&gt;          F#m
You were gone,      my heart was filled with dread.
E                B             C#m ~&gt; F#m E
You might not be sleeping here again.    
          
Chorus:

Dmaj9                A          F#m              D      A  E
But its all right, I love you.  That's not gonna change.
F#m                   B              E      G#sus4  G#  C#m
Run me round, make me hurt again and again.
C#m            B        A
But I'll still sing you love songs.
E       A      B          G#   C#m  A
Written in the letters of your name.
E             E (D bass)  -&gt;        A       -&gt;        F#m
And brave the storm to come, for it surely looks like rain.

E                                 A         -&gt;          F#m
Did you ever listen to the sound, of street cats making love,
E                         B                             C#m ~&gt; F#m E
And guess from their cries that you were listening to them fight?
E        C#m Dmaj9 A               -&gt;                          F#m
Well you know,     hate's just the last thing they're thinking of.
E                      B                   C#m ~&gt; F#m E                
They're only trying to make it through the night.

(Instrumental Chorus)

E                        A            -&gt;           F#m
I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down,
E                   B                  C#m ~&gt; F#m E
Or fence you in the lines I might have drawn.
E              C#m Dmaj9  A       -&gt;          F#m
It's just that I've gotten  used to having you around.
E                       B                 C#m ~&gt; F#m E
My landscape would be empty if you were gone.

(Chorus)
E             E (D bass)  -&gt;        A       -&gt;        F#m
And brave the storm to come, for it surely looks like rain.
