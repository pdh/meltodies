New San Antonio Rose by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys
 
         G                   C    A7
Deep within my heart, lies a melo-dy
  D                  G
a song of old San Antone.
                              C    A7
Where in dreams I live with a memo-ry
   D                    G
beneath the stars all alone.
                      C          A7
It was there I found, beside the Alamo
 D                         G
enchantment strange as the blue up above
               G7    C             A7
a moonlit pass that only she would know.
      D                       G
Still hears my broken song of love.

D
Moon in all your splendor
     A7
Know only my heart
                           D
Call back my rose, Rose of San Antone

Lips so sweet and tender
     A7
Like petals fallin' apart
                       D        D7
Speak once again of my love, my own
  G                  C       A7
A broken song, empty words I know
     D                    G
That live in my heart all alone
                      C          A7
For that moonlit path beside the Alamo
    D                       G
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone.
