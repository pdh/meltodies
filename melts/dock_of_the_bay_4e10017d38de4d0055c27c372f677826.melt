Artist: Otis Redding
Song: Dock Of the Bay
Tabbed by: John Leadman

   The chords are correct although they might not be in the right
   positions. It's really hard to hear the rhythm guitar in this
   song. These chord positions are just the ones I like to use.
   I haven't tabbed the lead guitar fills, which I think are played
   by Steve Cropper. For those of you who don't know Steve Cropper,
   he played in the Blues Brothers movie and is a great guitar player.
   And this is a great song.

   VERSE 1:

   G                      B
   Sittin' in the morning sun

           C              C B Bb  A
   I'll be sittin' in the evening come

   G                       B
   Watching the ships roll in,

          C                C B Bb A
   then I watch them roll away   again, yeah


   CHORUS:

       G                          E
   I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

                G          E
   watching the tide roll away

                G                          A
   ooh I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay

           G    E
   wasting ti---ime


   VERSE 2: [play like verse 1]

   I left my home in Georgia
   Headed for the Frisco bay
   'Cause I've had nothing to live for
   and look like nothing's gonna come my way


   CHORUS: [play like first chorus]

   So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
   watching the tide roll away, oooh
   I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
   wasting time


   BRIDGE:
   -
   G      D      C2
     Look like nothing's gonna change

   G      D         C2
          Everything still remains the same

   G      D             C2         G
        I can't do what ten people tell me to do

   F                    D
      So I guess I'll remain the same


   VERSE 3: [play like verses 1 &amp; 2]

   Sittin' here resting my bones
   and this loneliness won't leave me alone
   These 2000 miles I roamed
   just to make this dock my home


   CHORUS: [play like previous choruses]

   Now I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
   watching the tide roll away, oooh
   Sittin' on the dock of the bay
   wasting time


   OUTRO:

   G             E
   G             E
