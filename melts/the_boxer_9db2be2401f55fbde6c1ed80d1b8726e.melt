Intro : NC

A
I am just a poor boy

A                 A/G#   F#m
Though my story's seldom told

       E
I have squandered my resistance

      E7                              A
For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises

...

    A/G#     F#m
All lies and jests

        E                 D
Still a man hears what he wants to hear

                   A    E   E7      A
And disregards the rest hmm hmm hmm hmm

A
When I left my home and my family

         A/G#        F#m
I was no more than a boy

       E 
In the company of strangers

E      E7                           A
In the quiet of the railway station running scared

A/G#   F#m          E              D
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters

                        A
Where the ragged people go

        E              E7              A
Looking for the places only they would know

...    F#m    E    F#m   E..... A

Lie la lie ...

A
Asking only workman's wages

       A/G#    F#m
I come looking for a job

             E
But I get no offers,

       E7                                A
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue

  A/G#   F#m             E                D
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome

                    A           E       E7    A
I took some comfort there la la la la.....

A....A/G#..F#m..E....E7....A....A/G#..F#m..E..D....A..E...A

       F#m   E   F#m   E
Lie la lie ...

A
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes

A            A/G#  F#m
And wishing I was gone

      E
Going home

          E7                           A
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me

         E    F#m               E      E7   A
Bleeding me,              going home

A
In the clearing stands a boxer

A             F/G#   F#m
And a fighter by his trade

       E
And he carries the reminders

   E7
Of ev'ry glove that layed him down

   A
Or cut him till he cried out

A            A/G#    F#m
In his anger and his shame

      E             D
"I am leaving, I am leaving"

D                        A     E   E7  A
But the fighter still remains

A      F#m    E    F#m   E (ad lib)
Lie la lie ...
