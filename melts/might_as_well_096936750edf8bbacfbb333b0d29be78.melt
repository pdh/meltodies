Might As Well -- Grateful Dead  (Hunter, Garcia)
 
 
C                                   Bb
Great North Special with you all on board,
 
F                                  Eb
You can't find a ride like that no more.
 
D
The night the chariot swung down low,
 
G                          G7
Ninety-nine children had a chance to go.
 
 
One long party from front to end,
Tune to the whistle goin' 'round the bend,
No great hurry, what do you say?
Might as well to be every way.
 
 
C                             Bb
Might as well, might as well (might as well, might as well)
 
F                             Eb
Might as well, might as well (might as well, might as well)
 
D                             G
Might as well, might as well (might as well, might as well)
 
F                       C     F     F# G
Might as well, might as well (might as well)
 
F                       C     F     F# G
Might as well, might as well (might as well)
 
 
Ragtime slowly for twenty-five miles,
Then switch over to Cajun style.
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues,
Rock and roll wailing from the old caboose.
 
Long train running from coast to coast,
Bringin home a party when you need it most.
Work on the boxcar, beat on the bell.
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well.
 
 
Might as well...
 
(C, G)                   Bb F
Never had such a good time in my life before,
 
(F#, G)                      Bb
I'd like to have it one time more.
 
       F        A         G     E9
Whoa!  One good ride from start to end,
 
           A          Bb   F      F#  C
I'd like to take that ride again, again.
 
 
Ran out of track and I caught the plane,
Back in the country with the blues again.
Great North Special been on my mind,
I might like to ride it just one more time.
 
 
Might as well...
