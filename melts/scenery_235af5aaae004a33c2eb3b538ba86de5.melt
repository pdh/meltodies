At the scenery around you

Home of the brave

Sometimes they worship you
D              C                D     C     D     C
Sometimes they tear your houses down
D              C
Sometimes they comfort you

Nothing you can see

That they won't try to give you

Live by random selection

You sell your heart

Who will you love

In a world of constant strangers

I'll go with you
