************** DIDN'T WE SHINE ***************

written Don Schlitz and Jesse Winchester

performed by Waylon Jennings.

Capo on the 2nd fret.


Verse 1:
           D
	Hello,it's good to see you
                              Em
	Just how long has it been
               A
	I've often wondered what i'd say
                         D
	If we ever met again

 	If i'd try just being clever
               Em
	Or pretend not to remember
                    A
	But it's funny how you've lingered
               D
	On my mind


Chorus:
                    D
	Didn't we shine
                    Em
	Didn't we shine
          A
	Didn't we share and care
                                   D
	And lay our hearts on the line

	Maybe it wasn't meant to last
                         Em
	'Til the end of time
         A
	Oh,but while it did
                    D
	Didn't we shine


Verse 2:

	I still have some blue days
                           Em
	That i could do without
             A
	And when i have my blue days
                             D
	You're all i think about

	But i've long ago forgiven you
                Em
	For what you did or didn't do
             A
	Now all i can recall
                        D
	Are the happy times


Chorus.

            Em
	Was it my imagination
                       D
	Or didn't we shine
