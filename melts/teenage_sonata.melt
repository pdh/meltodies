#1.
C                 Am         F
Here, here in the moonlight..hold me while
  G7           C          Am           F
I sing to you..my teenage sonata of my love,
          G7
eternally true.

#2.
     C                       Am
It's written and filled with devotion..from
F          G7
deep in my heart.
         C           Am              F
And with my, teenage sonata, comes a prayer..
     G7          C
that we'll never part.

BRIDGE:
       F                        C
And as long as we love, it will stay..oh,
      F              G7
we'll hear it on our wedding day.
         C                   Am
Whoa-ohh-ooh-ahhh..oohh-oohh-oohh-aahh
          F                         G
oohh-oohh-oohh-aahh..oohh-oohh-oohh-aahh..
            G7
my, my, my, my, my, my..

#3.
   C                 Am
My lips, my lips can only kiss you..they, they
        F                     G7
can't explain how you make me feel.
    C           Am           F             G7
But my, teenage sonata, will tell you that my
        C
love is real.

OUTRO:

My love is real, oh, oh..whoa-ohh-ooh-ahhh..
               F                     G7
oohh-oohh-oohh-aahh..my, my, my, my, my, my
                        C
love is real..oohh-oohh-oohh-aahh..oohh-oohh-
Am
