This is the version of the song performed by Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson on the VH1 
album. The chords were derived from a jam session in which we performed this song one evening.

You may have to listen to a recording to get the feel for how the lyrics fit with the chords.


VERSE 1

G                  C
The place I go to draw my pay,
D                  G
Closed the door on me today.
         C       D
Told me just to stay away,
     G
And don't come back again.

VERSE 2
Ahh: I told my Mama: "Baby, don't you cry.
"I'll get a job before the day go by."
I don't know where, and that is why,
I'm a worried man.

CHORUS
Worried man, a worried man.
I'm a very worried man.
Hungry babies don't understand,
And their Papa is a worried man.
Papa is a worried man.


VERSE 3
There is no way that I can see,
That I can feed my family,
I don't own a money tree:
An' I don't own no land.

VERSE 4
I've got muscle and I've got brains.
I don't mind the sun an' the rain.
I gotta make a little change,
As I'm a worried, worried, worried man, ooh.

CHORUS

OUTRO
And their Papa is a worried man.
Papa is a worried man.
