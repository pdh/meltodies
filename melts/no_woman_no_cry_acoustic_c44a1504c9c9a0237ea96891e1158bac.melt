This is my first tab of a great song, yes its easy but ive been learning the 
guitar since Xmas so might be good for other novices expanding different songs.

I play each note twice then mute the strings each time when singing it, sounds ok 
i suppose, can be played normally  

Same all the way through G D/F# Em Cadd9

Standard Tuning

(Capo up to your voice)

intro G D/F# Em Cadd9 x2


G    D/F#      Em     Cadd9 
No, woman, no cry;
G    D/F#      Em     Cadd9          
No, woman, no cry;
G    D/F#      Em     Cadd9    
No, woman, no cry;
G    D/F#      Em     Cadd9
No, woman, no cry.

G        D/F#    Em                Cadd9
Cause I remember when a we used to sit
G          D/F#          Em         Cadd9            
In a government yard in Trenchtown,
G        D/F#     Em         Cadd9     
Oba - obaserving the 'ypocrites - yeah! -
G              D/F#          Em       Cadd9        
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah!
G               D/F#     Em                      Cadd9     G
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we have lost
D/F#        Em  Cadd9  G
Along the way, yeah!
    D/F#                  Em                  Cadd9      G
In this great future, you can't forget your past;
   D/F#            Em      Cadd9
So dry your tears, I seh. 

G    D/F#      Em   Cadd9
No, woman, no cry;
G    D/F#      Em   Cadd9
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!
G           D/F#    Em             Cadd9
Hey little darlin', don't shed no tears:
G    D/F#     Em     Cadd9
No, woman, no cry. Eh!

Said - said - said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah!
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
I seh, logwood burnin' through the nights, yeah!
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, say,
Of which I'll share with you, yeah!
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through.
Oh, while I'm gone,

Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right-a!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!
Everything's gonna be all right!

So no, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry.
I seh, O little - O little darlin', don't shed no tears;
No, woman, no cry, eh.

No, woman - no, woman - no, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry.
One more time I got to say:
O little - little darlin', please don't shed no tears;
No, woman, no cry.
