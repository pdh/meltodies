C       G          C             G 
JAH would never give the power to a baldhead 
Run come crucify the dread 
C       G	   C      G 
Time alone, oh! time will tell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Time alone, oh! time will tell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
 
Back them up, oh not the brothers 
But the ones, who set them up 
 
Time alone, oh! time will tell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Time alone, oh! time will tell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
 
Em                     G 
Oh children weep no more 
Oh my sycamore tree, saw the freedom tree 
Saw you settle the score Oh children weep no more 
Weep no more, children weep no more 
 
C           G                C          G 
JAH would never give the power to a baldhead 
Run come crucify the dread 
C           G       C       G 
Time alone, oh! time will tell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell 
Time alone, oh! time will tell 
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
