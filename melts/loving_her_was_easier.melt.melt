************* LOVING HER WAS EASIER **************

written and performed by Kris Kristofferson.


Verse 1:
             C/G                         F                            C/G
	I've seen the morning burning golden on the mountains in the skies
                                         F                          C/G
	Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
           F                                                            C/G
	Turning on the world the way she smiles upon my soul as i lay diing
                                         F                             C/G
	Healing with the colors of the sunshine and the shadow of her eyes


Verse 2:
            C/G                        F                         C/G
	Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
                                       F                            C/G
	Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that i've been
           F                                                              C/G
	Teaching me that yesterday was something that i never thought of trying
                                            F                           C/G
	Talking about tomorrow and the money love and time we'd have to spend
                                    G                    C/G
	Loving her was easier than anything i'll ever do again


Verse 3:
            C/G                         F                           C/G
	Coming close together with a feeling that i've never know before,in my time
                                   F                      C/G
	She ain't afraid to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
           F                                               C/G
	I don't know the answer to the easy way she opens every door in my mind
                                     F                      C/G
	Dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
                                    G                    C/G
	Loving her was easier than anything i'll ever do again
