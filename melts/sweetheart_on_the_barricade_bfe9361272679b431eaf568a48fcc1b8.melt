Sweetheart On The Barricade 
 
Bm                 F#             Bm            F#
They closed up the sooty gates of Ayres and Company
Bm              F#              E7
We stood on the picket line, my Jennifer and me
    Bm                 F#              E7
We blocked the street, now the lorries come and turn about
        G
There's nothing getting in there and there's nothing getting out

          D             G            D                G
Oh, she's just a tender thing, she's risking life and limb
   Bm           A           G
My sweetheart's on the barricade
   D                G                 D               G
My heart it skips a beat, there'll be fighting in the street
    Bm             A          G
But hungry folk forget to be afraid
                F#          Bm   E7  Bm F#
My sweetheart's on the barricade

And here come the managers to hit us on the sly
And tinpot generals with glory in their eyes
Owners, moaners, Judases and Janes
But righteousness is in our eyes, we've got no time for games

In her manner she is mild and fairly just a child
My sweetheart's on the barricade
For a fair wage in her hand, the equal of a man
She'll stand front rank in the parade
My sweetheart's on the barricade

Instrumental verses

D                                  A
She's running leaflets through the alley
D                               A      F#
She's passing hymn books at the rally. Halleluiah!
 
G
Friends and neighbours, won't you join the cause
D
Drill it in the tiny minds of them that make the laws
     G
That workers are human, we're really just the same
      E7
We've got to have the nourishment to fill a human frame

          Bm           G          Bm           G
Oh, we're people not a mob and we only wants a job
   Bm           A           G
My sweetheart's on the barricade
      Bm           G         Bm               G
We've had it up to here, too numb to feel the fear
   Bm           A           G 
My sweetheart's on the barricade
   Em               F#m              Em              F#m
My heart it skips a beat there'll be fighting in the street
   Em           F#          Bm
My sweetheart's on the barricade
