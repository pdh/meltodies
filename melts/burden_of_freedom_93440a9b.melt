Burden of Freedom
Kris Kristofferson


Not quite 100%, but it will get you started...


Intro:  G  A  D


                D  Dsus2  D
I stand on the stairway
               G
My back to the dungeon
               A
The doorway to freedom
               D
So close to my hand
               G
And voices behind me
              D
So bitterly damn me
             A
For seeking salvation
             D    Dsus2    D
They dont understand


Chorus:
                 Gm?
Lord, help me to shoulder
              D
The burden of freedom
                Gm?
And give me the courage
             A
To be what I can
               D
And when I am wounded
               G
By those who condemn me
                  A
Lord, help me forgive them
             D    Dsus2    D
They dont understand

 

Their lonely frustration
Descending to laughter
Erases the footprints
I leave in the sand
But Im free to travel
Where no one can follow
In search of the kingdom
They dont understand



Chorus:
                 Gm?
Lord, help me to shoulder
                D
The burden of freedom
                 Gm?
And give me the courage
            A
To be what I can
                 D
And when I have wounded
                 G
The last one who loved me
                 A
God help her forgive me
             D    Dsus2    D
I dont understand.



Gm?  3 3 4 5 5 3
