Intro: 
A


A          Bm              D        E
We used to have good times together
A         Bm              D    E
But now I feel them slip away
A           D   A           F#m
It makes me cry to see love die
A         Bm         E       A
So sad to watch good love go bad


A        Bm             D          E
Remember how we used to feel dear
A        Bm                        D     E
You said nothing could change your mind
A            D     A         F#m
It breaks my heart to see us part
A         Bm         E       A
So sad to watch good love go bad


D         Bm          E         A  
Is it any wonder that I feel so blue
D               Bm      F#m             E D C#m       
When I know for certain that I'm losing you


A        Bm             D         E
Remember how we used to feel dear
A        Bm                        D     E
You said nothing could change your mind
A            D     A         F#m
It breaks my heart to see us part
A         Bm         E       A
So sad to watch good love go bad
A         Bm         E       A
So sad to watch good love go bad
