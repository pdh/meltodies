//VERSE 1
   Am                             C
An ol' cowboy went riding out one dark-a-windy day
  Am
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
     Am
When all at once a mighty herd o' red-eyed cows he saw-
  F                                   Esus4         Am
A-plown' through the ragged sky-- and up the cloudy draw--

//VERSE 2
      Am                                  C
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made o'-steel
      Am
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
  Am 
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky-
       F                                   Esus4               Am
For he saw the riders coming ha--rd and he heard their moanful cry--

//CHORUS
Am       C
Yippy-yi-Ohhhh
   C        Am
Oh-Yippy-yi Yaaaay
F            Esus4  Am
Ghost Riders in the sky

//VERSE 3
      Am                                         C
Their faces gaunt, ther eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
     Am
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
               Am
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky-
   F                              Esus4              Am
On horses snortin' fire-- as they ride on hear their cry--

//VERSE 4
       Am                         C
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
       Am 
If you want to save your soul from Hell-a-ridin' on our range
     Am
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
F                                   Esus4                Am
Tryin' to catch the devil's he--rd, across these endless skies

//CHORUS
Am       C
Yippy-yi-Ohhhh
   C        Am
Oh-Yippy-yi Yaaaay
F            Esus4  Am
Ghost Riders in the sky

//ENDING
F            Esus4  Am
Ghost Riders in the sky
F            Esus4  Am
Ghost Riders in the sky
