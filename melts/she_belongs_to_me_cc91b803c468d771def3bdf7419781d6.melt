She Belongs To Me chords
Bob Dylan

Capo II

G

          G
She's got everything she needs,
         C                      G    C G
She's an artist, she don't look back.
          C
She's got everything she needs,
                                G    C G
She's an artist, she don't look back.
                 A
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
    C                 G    C G
And paint the daytime black.

         G
You will start out standing
C                               G    C G
Proud to steal her anything she sees.
         C
You will start out standing
                                G    C G
Proud to steal her anything she sees.
             A
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
C              G     C G
Down upon your knees.

G
She never stumbles,
          C           G    C G
She's got no place to fall.
    C
She never stumbles,
                      G    C G
She's got no place to fall.
      A
She's nobody's child,
    C                      G   C G
The Law can't touch her at all.

G C G (C G) C G (C G) A C G (C G)

    G
She wears an Egyptian ring
     C                   G      C G
That sparkles before she speaks.
    C
She wears an Egyptian ring
                         G      C G

        A
She's a hypnotist collector,
C                   G     C G
You are a walking antique.

    G
Bow down to her on Sunday,
C                            G     C G
Salute her when her birthday comes.
    C
Bow down to her on Sunday,
                             G     C G
Salute her when her birthday comes.
    A
For Halloween give her a trumpet
        C                     G     C G
And for Christmas, give her a drum. . . . .
