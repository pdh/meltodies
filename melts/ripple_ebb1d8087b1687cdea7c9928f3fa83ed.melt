Verse` 1
G                                     C
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
C                                        G
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
G                                        C     
Would you hear my voice come through the music
C         G       D    C               G  
Would you hold it near as it were your own?


Verse 2
G                                     C
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
C                             G 
Perhaps they're better left unsung
G                          C
I don't know, don't really care
G            D     C           G
Let there be songs to fill the air


(Chorus)
Am              D
Ripple in still water
           G            C
When there is no pebble tossed
    A       D
Nor wind to blow 


Verse 3
               G                   C
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
C                                G
If your cup is full may it be again
G                          C
Let it be known there is a fountain
G            D    C               G
That was not made by the hands of men 


Verse 4
G                          C
There is a road, no simple highway
C                                G
Between the dawn and the dark of night
G                        C
And if you go no one may follow
G            D   C          G
That path is for your steps alone


(Chorus) 


Verse 5
        G                   C
You who choose to lead must follow
C                          G
But if you fall you fall alone
G                                 C
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
G             D   C                G
If I knew the way I would take you home
