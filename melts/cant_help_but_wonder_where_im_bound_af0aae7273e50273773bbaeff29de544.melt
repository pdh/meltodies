Intro: 
Dm G C Am
Dm G C

       G    
It's a long and dusty road
       Dm            Am
It's a hot and heavy load
        G7                        C
And the folks I meet ain't always kind
         G
Some are bad and some are good
          Dm                 Am
Some have done the best they could
          G7                          C
Some have tried to ease my trouble in mind

      Dm             G                C                Am
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Dm             G                C
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound 

          G
I've been wandering through this land
     Dm               Am
Just doin' the best I can
          G7                       C
Trying to find what I was meant to do
        G
And the people that I see
        Dm             Am
Look as worried as can be
       G7                            C
And it looks like they are wand’rin’ too

      G    
But I had me a buddy back home
       Dm             Am
And he started off to roam
         G7                  C
Now he’s out, gone to Frisco Bay
    G
And sometimes when I've had a few
        Dm                  Am
His old voice comes ringin' through
            G7                            C
And yes I'm goin' out to see him some old day

       G    
If you see me passin' by
        Dm                 Am
And you sit and you wonder why
        G7                            C
And you wish that you were a rambler, too
          G
nail your shoes to the kitchen floor
       Dm              Am
Lace'em up and bar the door
           G7                             C
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you
