by JStMarie


C
Yeah I'm bringin' home some good news
Got some things you'll be glad to hear
Like I'm leavin' town and won't be back Around 
just long enough to get my gear
            F
There won't be any goodbye kisses
                                C
Well I'm puttin' on my leavin' shoes
            G7
This is the end we're through it's over yeah
F            G7            C
I'm bringin' home some good news

Well I was sittin' downtown in a tavern
And I made up my mind to go
And I knew you would be so glad to be free
I just thought to call you to let you know
Oh you can tell all your backdoor daddys
That your big daddy's done blew a fuse
This is the end we're through it's over yeah
I'm bringin' home some good news

To you I been known as bad news
Well I'm changin' my first name
And I'm givin' you your freedom baby
That oughta rate some kind of change
You won't have to hide your milkman's slippers
I won't be lookin' around for clues
This is the end we're through it's over
Yeah I'm bringin' home some good news

Good news there's some good news for you honey
I'm bringin' home some good news
I'm bringin' home some good news honey
