This is how I saw it fit, enjoy. standard tuning.




C                   G              Am
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
F                       G
  If you don't know by now
         C              G              Am
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
F                   G
 It'll never do somehow
            C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
F                           Am
Look out your window and   I'll be gone
C            G        Am
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
    F             G              C
but Don't think twice, it's all right


(harmonica)


    C                   G               Am
an' It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
      F              G
The light I never knowed
        C                G              Am
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
F                             G
 I'm on the dark side of the  road
         C7
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
F                             Am
To try and make me change my mind and stay
C         G           Am
We never did too much talkin' anyway
    F           G              C
but don't think twice, it's all right


(harmonica)


C                     G              Am
So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F                     G
 Like you never done before
    C                  G              Am
an' It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F                     G
 I can't hear you any more
       C7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walking down the road
  F                      Am
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
   C            G            Am
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
    F            G               C
But don't think twice, it's all right


(harmonica...again...)



C   G          Am
So long, honey babe
          F              G
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
C         G          Am
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
F                          G
 So I'll just say fare thee well
C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    F                           Am
You could have done better but I don't mind
C              G         Am
You just kinda wasted my precious time
     F          G               C
But don't think twice, it's all right
