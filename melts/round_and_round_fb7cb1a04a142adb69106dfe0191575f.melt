Round and Round (It Wonâ€™t Be Long) chords
Neil Young

G

G
Round and round and round we spin,

To weave a wall to hem us in,
               Gsus4 G            Am   D
It won't be long,     it won't be long
    G
How slow and slow and slow it goes,

To mend the tear that always shows.
               Gsus4 G             Am   D
It won't be long,      it won't be long.

     G
It's hard enough losin'

the paper illusion
       Am
you've hidden inside,
    G
Without the confusion

of findin' you're usin'
    Am
the crutch of the lie
   Cm                          D    Dsus4 D Dsus4
To shelter your pride when you cry.

G
Round and round and round we spin,

To weave a wall to hem us in,
               Gsus4 G            Am   D
It won't be long,     it won't be long
    G
How slow and slow and slow it goes,

To mend the tear that always shows.
               Gsus4 G             Am   D
It won't be long,      it won't be long.

           G
Now you're movin' too slow

and wherever you go
         Am
there's another beside.
        G
It's so hard to say no

to yourself and it shows
            Am
that you're losing inside,
         Cm                         D   Dsus4 D Dsus4
When you step on your pride and you cry.

G
Round and round and round we spin,

To weave a wall to hem us in,
               Gsus4 G            Am   D
It won't be long,     it won't be long
    G
How slow and slow and slow it goes,

To mend the tear that always shows.
               Gsus4 G             Am   D
It won't be long,      it won't be long.

        G
How the hours will bend

through the time that you spend
         Am
till you turn to your eyes,
        G
And you see your best friend

looking over the end
        Am
and you turn to see why,
       Cm                        D     Dsus4 D Dsus4
And he looks in your eyes and he cries.

G
Round and round and round we spin,

To weave a wall to hem us in,
               Gsus4 G            Am   D
It won't be long,     it won't be long
    G
How slow and slow and slow it goes,

To mend the tear that always shows.
               Gsus4 G             Am   D
It won't be long,      it won't be long.

G            Am
Oooo  oooo oooo   3x
