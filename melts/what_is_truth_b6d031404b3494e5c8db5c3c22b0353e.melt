Intro:

|     E     |     A     |C#7  B7|     E     |
|     E     |     E     |

        E
The old man turned off the radio,
A
Said, "Where did all of the old songs go?
F#
     Kids sure play funny music these days,
B7
     And they play it in the strangest ways."
E
     Said, "It looks to me like they've all gone wild.
A
     It was peaceful back when I was a child."
         F#
Well, man, could it be that the the girls and boys
       B7
Are tryin' to be heard above your noise?
              E                     A               B7                  E
And the lonely voice of youth cries,        "What is truth?"

    E
A little boy of three sittin' on the floor
A
Looks up and says, "Daddy, what is war?"
F#
     "Son, that's when people fight and die."
    B7
A little boy of three says, "Daddy, why?"
    E
A young man of seventeen in Sunday school,
A
     Bein' taught the golden rule.
                  F#
And by the time another year has gone around,
           B7
It may be his turn to lay his life down.
        E                                  A                       B7                  E
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking,        "What is truth?"


Interlude:

    E
A young man sittin' on the witness stand.
       A
The man with the book says, "Raise your hand.
      F#
Re-peat after me. I solemnly swear."
        B7
The man looked down at his long hair.
        E
And although the young man solemnly swore,
A
      Nobody seemed to hear anymore.
           F#
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there,
           B7
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair.
             E                      A                B7                  E
And the lonely voice of youth cries,         "What is truth?"

E
A young girl dancin' to the latest beat
        A
Has found new ways to move her feet.
    F#
A young man speakin' in the city square
    B7
Is tryin' to tell somebody that he cares.
E
      Yeah, the ones that you're callin' wild
       A
Are gonna be the leaders in a little while.
        F#
This old world's wakin' to a newborn day
                                                             B7
And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way.
                  E                         A               B7                  E
You better help that voice of youth find            what is truth.
                                      A               B7                   E
And the lonely voice of youth cries,          "What is truth?"
