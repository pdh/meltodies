Intro: Am  C  Dm  F  Am  Em  Am  

      Am   C             Dm     F

There is a house down in New Orleans

     Am       C      Em

They call the Risin' Sun

         Am       C       Dm        F

And it's been the ruin of many poor girl

    Am     Em         Am    C  Dm  F  Em  

And me, oh God, I'm a-one

 

2)

My mother was a taylor

She sewed these new blue jeans

My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord

Down in New Orleans

 

3)

Now the only thing a gambler needs

Is a suitcase and a trunk

And the only time he's satisfied

Is when he's on a drunk

 

4)

He fills his glasses up to the brim

And he'll pace the cards around

And the only pleasure he gets out of life

Is ramblin' from town to town

 

5)

Oh tell my baby sister

Not to do as I have done

But to shun that house in New Orleans

They call the Risin' Sun

 

6)

Well, it's one foot on the platform

And the other foot on the train

I'm goin' back to New Orleans

To wear that ball and chain

 

7)

I'm a-goin' back to New Orleans

My race is almost run

I'm goin' back to end my life

Down in the Risin' Sun

 

8)

There is a house in New Orleans

They call the Risin' Sun

It's been the ruin of many poor girl

And me, oh God, Im a-one
