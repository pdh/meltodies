Capo on the 2nd fret.


Verse 1:
  A  G   A                   G                    A
	Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
                         G                     A
	Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
         D                     E    D
	How many hearts must break,how many will it take
                    A D                 A
	To satisfy you,just to satisfy you


Bridge:
          B
	Another love,another fool
            E
	To play your game
          B
	Another love,another fool
             E
	They're all the same


Verse 2:
         A                   G                    A
	Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
	                      G           A
	Don't be surprised if that someone is you
	              D                  E       D
	You're gonna find when it's too late,a heart that just won't break
                    A D                 A
	To satisfy you,just to satisfy you


Half a verse:
         D                    E    D
	How many tears were cried,how many dreams have died
                    A D                 A
	To satisfy you,just to satisfy you
