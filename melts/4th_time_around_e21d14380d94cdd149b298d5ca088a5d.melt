Intro.: (E A)3x B7 F#m 
 
E    A     
When she said, 
        E          A                   E 
"Don't waste your words, they're just lies," 
    A            E       A 
I cried she was deaf.             
    E       A         E      A              E  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes, 
      A                        E       A 
Then said, "What else you got left?" 
       B7 
It was then that I got up to leave 
                        F#m    
But she said, "Don't forget, 
     E         A              E 
Everybody must give something back 
        A          E        A 
For something they get." 
    

intro
E                  A
I stood there and hummed, 
   E                      A            E
I tapped on her drum and asked her how come. 
A             E       A
And she buttoned her boot, 
E       A          E   A E
And straightened her suit, 
A          E           A
Then she said, "Don't get cute." 
                          F#m
So I forced my hands in my pockets 
E            A      E
And felt with my thumbs, 
E           A        E
And gallantly handed her 
A               E      A
My very last piece of gum. 

intro

 E             A
She threw me outside, 
       E                 A         E
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked. 
A            E     A
And after finding I'd 
E     A     E      A E
Forgotten my shirt, 
A           E        A
I went back and knocked. 
  B7
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, 
                      F#m
And I tried to make sense 
E               A                    E
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair 
A             E A
That leaned up against . . . 

intro

 E          A
Her Jamaican rum 
       E               A              E
And when she did come, I asked her for some. 
A           E   A
She said, "No, dear." 
E        A         E        A      E
I said, "Your words aren't clear, 
A                  E         A
You'd better spit out your gum." 
B7
She screamed till her face got so red 
                      F#m
Then she fell on the floor, 
E             A           E
And I covered her up and then 
A                  E             A
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  

intro

E                   A
And, when I was through 
E     A        E
I filled up my shoe 
A          E        A
And brought it to you. 
E   A      E   A          E
And you, you took me in, 
A         E      A
You loved me then 
B7
You didn't waste time. 
                    F#m
And I, I never took much, 
E            A          E
I never asked for your crutch. 
A          E       A
Now don't ask for mine.


Enjoy!
