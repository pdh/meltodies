Intro: C, F, C, G
       C                F               C /B /Bb A7
Well I don't know why I love you like I do
   D7                     G              C
Nobody in the world could get along with you
                            F                    C /B /Bb A7
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
       D7                  G                     C
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in
   E                             F
Oh sometimes you are sweet as anybody'd want to be
D7                          G
Then you get a crazy notion jumpin all over me
         C                   F                 C /B /Bb A7
When you give me the blues I guess you're satisfied
         D7                  G                    C  
When you give me the blues I want to lay down and die
