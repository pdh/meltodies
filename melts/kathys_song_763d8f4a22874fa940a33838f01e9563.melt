 I looked everywhere for a version of this song that I could strum &amp; sing but 
couldnt find any so I put these chords together, I think they work well with the 
song

     G                                   C          D7/F#
    I hear the drizzle of the rain       Like a memory it falls 

    G        D/F#    G     C             Am      Gsus    D       G
    soft and warm continuing             tapping on my roof and walls

     G                                   C          D7/F#        
    and from the shelter of my mind      to the window of my eyes


   G        D/F#      G          C         Am      D          C       G
 I gaze beyond the rain drenched streets  to england where my heart lies


    The Last four chord progression that I tabbed is the only part in the song 
that does that, all the other verses end just like "tapping on my roof and walls" 

     The F# notes can be eisily done by thumbing F# on the respective D chord

    Enjoy!
