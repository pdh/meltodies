Under my thumb
by Rolling Stones

                Em         D       C
     Under my thumb's the girl who once had me down
                Em         D             C
     Under my thumb's the girl who once pushed me around

                       G
Chorus : It's down to me
        C                             A
        The diff'rence in the clothes she wears
                      Em
        It's down to me
                            D        C     G
        The change has come. She's under my thumb.

     Under my thumb's a squirming dog who's just had her day
     under my thumb's a girl who has just changed her ways

Chorus: It's down to me
        The way she does just what she's told
        It's down to me
        The change has come. She's under my thumb.

     Under my thumb' a slamese cat of a girl
     Under my thumb she's the sweetest pet in the world

Chorus

     Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself
     Under my thumb well I - I can still look at someone else


Chorus: It's down to me
        The way are talks when she's spoken to
        It's down to me
        The change has come. She's under my thumb.
