I saw another posting of this that works, but I believe this is
more accurate.  The other posting gives all the lyrics, but this
will giove you the idea.  Johnny Cash is the MAN.


Wayfarin Stranger

Em
I'm just a poor wayfarin stranger
          Am                    B7
Travelin' through this world of woe
               Em
But there's no sickness, toil or danger
               Am
In that bright world
           Em
To which I go.

I'm going there to meet my father
              Am               Em
And I'm going there no more to roam

I'm just going over Jordan
         Am         Em
I'm just going over home.
