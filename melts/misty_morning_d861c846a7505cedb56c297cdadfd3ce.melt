Verse 1:

Bm              E7  G          A  Bm
 Misty morning;      don't see no sun.
Bm             E7                  G   A    Bm
 I know you're out there somewhere, ha-ving fun.

Bm            E7         G          A  Bm
 There is one mystery; I just can't ex-press.
Bm            E7   G           A    Bm
 To give your more, to receive your less.

Bm        E7                G            A   Bm
 One a my good friends said, in a reggae rid-dim:
Bm                 E7    G       A     Bm
 Don't jump in the water, if you can't swim.

Verse 2:

Bm                E7
 The power of phi-losophy, yeah,
G               A  Bm
 Floats through my head.
Bm            E7       G      A  Bm
 Light like a feather,  heavy as lead.
Bm            E7       G      A  Bm
 Light like a feather,  heavy as lead.

Interlude:

Bm  E7,  G  A  Bm
                See no sun...
Bm  E7,  G  A  Bm
                Time has come, I want you.

Chorus 1:

G              A                    Bm     E7
 I want you to straighten out my to-morrow.
G              A                    Bm     E7
 I want you to straighten out my to-morrow.
G              A                    Bm     E7
 I want you to straighten out my to-morrow.

Verse 3:

Bm     E7         G          A  Bm
 Misty,  morning;  don't see no sun.
Bm             E7                   G   A    Bm
 I know you're out there somewhere,  ha-ving fun.

Bm  E7           G          A  Bm
    Mysteries, I just can't ex-press.
Bm           E7                  G           A    Bm
 How can you ever give your more, to receive your less?

Bm        E7                G            A   Bm
 One a my good friends said, in a reggae rid-dim:
Bm                 E7                G       A     Bm
 Can't jump, can't jump in the water, if you can't swim. I want you...

Chorus 2:

G              A                    Bm                      E7
 I want you to straighten out my to-day, my tomorrow, my my my my my.
G              A                    Bm           E7
 I want you to straighten out my to-morrow, in a misty morning.

G              A                    Bm     E7
 I want you to straighten out my to-morrow,
G              A                    Bm     E7
 I want you to straighten out my to-morrow.
