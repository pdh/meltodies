  Red red wine,
             G  C  D
  Go to my head,
                    G  C  D
  Make me forget that I
             G  C  D
  Still need her so,
              G  C  D
  Red red wine,
             G  C  D 
  It's up to you,
                G  C  D
  All I can do I've done,
                   G C D
  But memories won't go,
       D             C D   
  No, memories won't go..

             D
  I have sworn,
              G
  That with time,
              C                 G
  Thoughts of you would leave my head,
          D          G
  I was wrong and I find,
             C                 D
  Just one thing makes me forget...

          G C D  
  Red red wine,
                 G C D
  Stay close to me,
                  G C D
  Don't let me be alone,
                  G C D
  It's tearing apart
     D              C D
  My blue, blue heart.
