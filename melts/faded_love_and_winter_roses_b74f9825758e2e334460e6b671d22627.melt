D                            A7                  D
Faded love and winter roses  always bloom in memory
                             A7                           D
Faded love and winter roses  yearning hearts that used to be
G                              D                     A7
Will they meet again tomorrow  where we parted yesterday
D                              A7                     D
Give me back the winter roses  and the love you took away
 
                             A7                      D
Faded love and winter roses  sprinkled with a lonely tear
                             A7                      D
Faded love and winter roses  still recall each yesteryear
G                           D                       A7
Will I always be a dream-er dreaming of the used to be
D                            A7               D
Faded love and winter roses live and die in memory
--
End.
