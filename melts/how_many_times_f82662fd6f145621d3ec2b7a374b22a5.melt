G             D        C     D  G
How many times must I get up
                D              C    D  G
Look out and see the same old view
              D        C         
How many times must I wear the same old things
     D                  C           Am       D  G
And hear the same old things that I do, I do
              D         C                     D  G
How many times must I clean this face my face
                  D         C                     D  G
And how many times must I shine my shoes, oh Lord
              D         C         
How many times must I drink the same old drink
      D                  C           Am
And dream the same old dreams that I do

CHORUS
 D      G      D            C
Because I, I know one thing
  D          G                      D         C
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain
 D       G    D        C    G D
But for your line and mine
             C      Am    D    G
I want that loving again,    again

How many times must I pass your place. your place
And how many times must I follow you, you
How many times must I see the same old things
When all I should be seeing is you

CHORUS
