Tuning:Standard

This is normally done with two guitars, but I left the electric out so this is for a 
acoustic guitar. I only submitted the chords here, not the fingerpicking

CAPO III

-Verse 1-

       G
Well I followed her to the station
G7
     with a suitcase in my hand
       C
Yeah I followed her to the station
D7/F#
      with a suitcase in my hand

Instrumental Break -  G      D      Gus4
G            D                        D/F#
  Well it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
Em7                 C        G7         D
    when all your love's in vain

-Verse 2-

           G
When the train come in the station
G7
     I looked her in the eye
          C
Well the train come in the station
D7/F#
      and I looked her in the eye

Instrumental Break -  G      D      Gus4
G          D               D/F#
  Whoa I felt so sad so lonesome
Em7                   C        G7         D
    that I could not help  but cry

(There is usually a mandolin in this part, so you can either go right into verse 3 or 
a little something of your own to fill the song out)

-Verse 3-

          G
When the train left the station
G7
     it had two lights on behind
                C
Yeah, when the train left the station
D7/F#
     it had two lights on behind

Instrumental Break -  G      D      Gus4
G            D               D/F#
  Whoa the blue light was my baby
Em7                 C        G7         D
    when all your love's in vain       G
Well I followed her to the station
G7
     with a suitcase in my hand
       C
Yeah I followed her to the station
D7/F#
      with a suitcase in my hand

Instrumental Break -  G      D      Gus4
G            D                        D/F#
  Well it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
Em7               C           G7         D
    and the red light was my mind

-Outro-

G                 G7
All my love's in vain
C                   D7/F#
Ooo                         hey hey

Instrumental Break - G    D    Gsus4    G

D                  D/F#
Ooo
Em7      C         G7       D
All my love's in vain

G7
