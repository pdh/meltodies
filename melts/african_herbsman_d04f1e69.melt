Bb             Gm
 All twinklin' lee,
              Bb                             Gm
Can't see the right rose, when the streams a-bate.
    Bb             Gm                              Eb    F
The old slave men, might grind slow, but it grinds fine, yeah.

Chorus 1:

        Bb                   Gm
African Herbsman, why linger on?
            Bb                       Gm
Just concen-trate, 'cos Heaven lives on.
            Bb                         Gm
Greet-I-eth slave men will look with a-scorn,
                    Eb      F (n.C)                      Bb
With a transplanted heart... (yes, how quick they had to part).
             Gm
(They had to part)...

Verse 2:

       Bb              Gm
The re-membrance of to-day,
           Bb            Gm
Is the sad feelin' of to-morrow.

(Yes, how quick they had to part...), oh yeah.

Chorus 2:

African Herbsman, seize your time,
              Bb                       Gm
I'm takin' il-lusion on the edge of my mind.
           Bb                     Gm
I'm takin' losers down through my life,
                Eb           F (n.C)                      Bb
Down through my life, yeah... (yes, how quick they had to part).

(Yes, how quick they had to part...)

Chorus 3:

        Bb                   Gm
African Herbsman, why linger on?

Just concen-trate, 'cos Heaven lives on.
            Bb                         Gm
Greet-I-eth slave men will look with a-scorn,
                    Eb      F (n.C)                      Bb
With a transplanted heart... (yes, how quick they had to part).

      Bb              Gm
In re-membrance of to-day,

Brings sad feelings of to-morrow.
                            Bb
(Yes, how quick they had to part...)
