       Bm            
I am a poor wayfarin' stranger
              Em                    Bm
I'm traveling through this world of woe
               Bm
Yet there's no sickness, toil nor danger
        Em                      Bm
In that bright world to which I go


           G               Em
I'm going there to see my father
           G                 Bm
I'm going there, no more to roam
          D          Bm
I'm only going over Jordan
          Em        Bm
I'm only going over home


            Bm
I know that dark clouds will gather 'round me
          Em               Bm
I know my way is rough and steep
              Bm
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
               Em                  Bm
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep


           G               Em
I'm going there to see my mother
               G              Bm
She said she'd meet me when I come
          D           Bm
I'm only going over Jordan
          Em        Bm
I'm only going over home


       Bm
I am a poor wayfarin' stranger
                 Em                   Bm
While travelin' through this world of woe
               Bm
Yet there's no sickness, toil nor danger
        Em                      Bm
In that bright world to which I go


          G               Em
I'm going there to see my father
           G                 Bm
I'm going there, no more to roam
         D           Bm
I'm only going over Jordan
         Em         Bm
I'm only going over home
