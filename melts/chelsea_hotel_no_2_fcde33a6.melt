Verse1:     C                      F             C
        I remember you well in the Celsea Hotel,
                            G             Am
        You were talking so brave and so sweet;
        C         G           F           C
        Giving me head on the unmade bed,
                  F                       G
        While the limousines waitin the street.
        Am                         F
        Those were the reasons and that was New York,
                C               E/B            Am
        We were running for the money and the flesh.
            F                            C
        And that was called love for the workers in song,
                 F                           G
        Probably still is for those of them left.



Chorus1:           F             C
           Ah, but you got away, didn't you babe,
                                 E/B         Am
           You just turned your back on the crowd,
           F                         C
           You got away,I never once heard you say:
             F                 C
           "I need you,I don't need you,
             F                 C
           I need you, I don't need you"
               F                   Am       G
           And all of that jiving around.


Verse2:      C          G           F             C
         I remember you well in the Celsea Hotel:
                               G           Am
         You were famous, your heart was a legend.
             C        G                  F            C
         You told me again you preferred handsome men
                 F                               G
         But for me you would make an exception.
             Am                          F
         And clenching your fist for the ones like us
                    C             E/B        Am
         Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,
             F                          C
         You fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind,
                F                    G
         We are ugly but we have the music."



Chorus2:            F               C
           And then you got away, didn't you baby,
                               E/B         Am
           You just turned your back on the crowd,
           F                          C
           You got away, I never once heard you say:
             F                 C
           "I need you,I don't need you,
             F                 C
           I need you, I don't need you"
               F                   Am       G
           And all of that jiving around.



Verse3:           C           G           F                   C
          I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best,
                                G             Am
          I can't keep track of each fallen robin.
              C          G           F              C
          I remember you well in the Celsea Hotel,
                 F                                    G
          That's all, aI don't even think of you that often.
