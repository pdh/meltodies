Intro: D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus D Dsus (4x)

The Chords remain the same for all verses.

I use barre chords for the B minor and G major chords. Though not necessary. 

Progression as follows: D Dsus Bm Gmaj A

The Dsus chord achieved by placing Pinky finger on E string 3rd fret while playing D chord.


D                   Bm
Crimson flames tied through my ears
        Gmaj            A
Rollin' high and mighty trapped.
D                     Bm 
Pounced with fire and flaming roads
Gmaj              A
Using ideas as my maps
D                   Bm
We'll meet on edges soon said I
Gmaj               A
Proud neath heated brow.
        D             Bm
Ah, But I was so much older then
    Gmaj    A         D    Dsus D Dsus
I'm younger than that now.


D                      Bm
Half wracked prejudice leaped forth
    Gmaj            A 
Rip down all hate I screamed.
D                 Bm
Lies that life is black and white
Gmaj                  A
Spoke from my skull I dreamed.
D                 Bm
Romantic facts of musketeers
    Gmaj          A
Foundationed deep somehow.
        D             Bm
Ah, but I was so much older then
    Gmaj    A         D   Dsus D Dsus      
I'm younger than that now.


Dsus  D                       Bm
Girls faces formed the forward path
     Gmaj         A
From phony jealousy
   D          Bm          Gmaj          A 
To memorizing politics of ancient history.
      D               Bm
Flung down by corpse evangelists
  Gmaj                  A
Unthought of though somehow
        D             Bm
Ah, but I was so much older then
    Gmaj    A         D   Dsus D Dsus
I'm younger than that now.


Dsus D                Bm 
A    self ordained professor's tongue
    Gmaj       A
Too serious to fool
D                Bm
Spouted out that liberty
         Gmaj       A 
is just equality in school.
 D          Bm
Equality, I spoke the word
   Gmaj         A
As if a wedding vow.
        D             Bm
Ah, but I was so much older then
    Gmaj    A         D   Dsus D Dsus
I'm younger than that now.


Dsus  D                    Bm 
In    a soldiers stance, I aimed my hand
       Gmaj             A
At the mongrel dogs who teach
        D                  Bm
Fearing not I'd become thy enemy
       Gmaj           A
In the instant that I preach.
      D                Bm
My existence led by confusion boats
Gmaj                 A
Mutiny from stern to bow.
        D             Bm
Ah, but I was so much older then
    Gmaj    A         D   Dsus D Dsus
I'm younger than that now.


D                        Bm
My guard stood hard with abstract threats
    Gmaj        A
Too noble to neglect
  D              Bm 
Deceived me into thinking
      Gmaj            A
I had something to protect.
D                 Bm
Good and bad, I define these terms
      Gmaj                 A
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
        D             Bm 
Ah, but I was so much older then
    Gmaj    A         D   Dsus D Dsus to fade
I'm younger than that now.
