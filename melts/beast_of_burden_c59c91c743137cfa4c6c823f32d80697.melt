E                  C#m      A
I'll never be your beast of burden; 
E                    C#m    A
my back is broad but it's a hurting 
E                 C#m         A       E
All I want is for you to make love to me 
E                  C#m      A
I'll never be your beast of burden; 
E                        C#m      A
I've walked for miles my feet are hurting 
E                 C#m         A       E
All I want is for you to make love to me 

     A
Am I hard enough?

Am I rough enough? 
     A
Am I rich enough? 
            E        B

E                  C#m      A
I'll never be your beast of burden, 
E                    C#m      A

     A
Am I hard enough?

        E
You can put me out, 
C#m    A
on the street 
E
Put me out, 
        C#m         A
with no shoes on my feet 
E
But, put me out, put me out, 
C#m           A   E
put me out of misery 

      E
Yeah, all your sickness, 
      C#m     A
I can suck it up 
E
Throw it all at me,
      C#m      A
I can shrug it off 
E
There's one thing baby, 
C#m          A    E
that I don't understand
E           C#m 
You keep on telling me, 
  A                  E
I ain't your kind of man 

        A
Ain't I rough enough, ooh baby 
        E
Ain't I tough enough? 
        A
Ain't I rich enough, in love enough 
E         B
Ooh! Ooh! Please 

E                  C#m      A
I'll never be your beast of burden 
E                  C#m      A
I'll never be your beast of burden 
E             C#m           A                   E
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be 

E                  C#m      A
I'll never be your beast of burden; 
E                        C#m      A
I've walked for miles my feet are hurting . . .
