What Did You Learn In School Today (Tom Paxton, Pete Seeger)

&lt;chorus&gt;:
G                                                      D7
What did you learn in school today, dear little boy of mine,
G                                   D7                 G-G7
What did you learn in school today, dear little boy of mine?

  C                       G
I learned that Washington never told a lie,
  C                     G
I learned that soldiers seldom die.
  C                 G
I learned that everybody's free,
C                       G
That's what the teacher said to me.
    G                                      D7                       G
And that's what I learned in school today, that's what I learned in school.

&lt;chorus&gt;

  C                      G
I learned that policemen are my friends,
  C                    G
I learned that justice never ends.
  C                      G
I learned that murderers die for their crimes,
C                    G
Even if we make a mistake sometimes.
    G                                      D7                       G
And that's what I learned in school today, that's what I learned in school.

&lt;chorus&gt;

  C                     G
I learned that wars are not so bad,
  C                         G
I learned of the great ones we have had.
   C                        G
We fought in Germany and in France,
    C                      G
And someday I might get my chance.
    G                                      D7                       G
And that's what I learned in school today, that's what I learned in school.

&lt;chorus&gt;

  C                              G
I learned our government must be strong,
     C                      G
It's always right and never wrong.
    C                      G
Our leaders are the finest men,
    C                 G
And so we elect them again and again.
    G                                      D7                       G
And that's what I learned in school today, that's what I learned in school.
