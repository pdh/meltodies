D   G


           G
Now you're lookin at a man thats getting kinda mad
  G
I had lots of luck but it's all been bad
   D7
No matter how I struggle and strive
                                 G
I'll never get out of this world alive.


   G
My fishin poles broke the creek is full of sand
   G
My woman run away with another man

A distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch 
    C                                  
And I was living high until that fatal day
         D7
A lawyer proved I wasn't born
           G
I was only hatched


G
Everythings agin me and its got me down
G
If I jumped in the river I would probably drown
   D7
No matter how I struggle and strive
                                 G
I'll never get out of this world alive.

       C
These shabby shoes I'm wearin all the time

And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime
        D7                                         G
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails.


G
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
G
Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright nohow
   D7
No matter how I struggle and strive
                                 G
I'll never get out of this world alive.
