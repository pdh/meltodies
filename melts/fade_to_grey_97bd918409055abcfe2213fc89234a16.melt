*note--in the intro, verse 1, and first chorus, there is no guitar but I
have listed the chords anyway*


Intro:
Cm Fm7 Bb Gm7


Verse 1:
Cm7                  Fm7                      Bb
        Oh, it's not hard to know what you're thinking


         Gm7             Cm7
When you look down on me now


     Fm7               Bb
Your trance of love is seeking


   Gm7              Cm7
To turn this world around


          Fm7               Bb
But in my state of blind confusion


   Gm7             Cm7
No god can pull me out


  Fm7              Bb
I see your love is willing


   Gm7            Cm
To turn me inside out

Chorus 1:


G                  C2              Bb6       Dm7
        And then I see you there


G                  C2              Bb
        The lonely tears I cry


  Dm7
I wish they'd release me

Verse 2:


Cm7                Fm7              Bb
        It's in despair that I find faith


Gm7                      Cm7
Summons the night to bow down to day


     Fm7          Bb
When ignorance is bliss


          Gm7            Cm
Won't you save me from myself

Chorus 2:


G                  C2
        And then I see you there


          Bb6                    Dm7
With your arms open wide and you try to embrace me


G                    C2
        These lonely tears I cry


     Bb6                     Dm7
They keep me in chains and I wish they'd release me


G                   C2
        Cold is the night but


       Bb6                        Dm7
Colder still is the heart made of stone turned from clay


G                  C2
        And if you follow me


       Bb6                        Dm7
You'll see all the black, all the white, fade to grey

Fade to grey, yeah   (repeat 2x)


Chorus 2:


G                  C2
        And then I see you there


          Bb6                    Dm7
With your arms open wide and you try to embrace me


G                    C2
        These lonely tears I cry


     Bb6                     Dm7
They keep me in chains and I wish they'd release me


G                   C2
        Cold is the night but


       Bb6                        Dm7
Colder still is the heart made of stone turned from clay


G                  C2
        And if you follow me


       Bb6                        Dm7
You'll see all the black, all the white, fade to grey


        *repeat chorus 2*
