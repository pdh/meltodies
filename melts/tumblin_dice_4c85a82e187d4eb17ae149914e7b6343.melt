B
Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
                                          
And make me burn the candle right down,
                  
    F#  B F#  B          E
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown.


 B
'Cause all you women is low down gamblers,
                                
Cheatin' like I don't know how
    F# B  F# B          E                    F#
But baby, baby, there's fever in the funk house now.
B
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a itchin',
B                                         
You know you know the duece is still wild.


F# B  F# B                      E
Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
E                        B
And call me the tumblin' dice.

B
Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry,
B                                   
Don't you see the time flashin' by.
F#  B F#  B
Honey, got no money,
        E                    F#
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines.
B
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider,
B                                
You can be my partner in crime.

   F#  B    F#    B
But baby, I can't stay,
           E            
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin',
E                                 B
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice.

Lead



B
Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter,
B                             
Playin' the field ev'ry night.

F# B  F#    B
Baby, can't stay,
           E                       
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice, (Call me the tumblin')
           E           B           F#           
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice,
