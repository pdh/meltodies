Too Late To Come Fishing 

     D			   Bm
When you were a vixen and I was a chump
    F#m			 G 
You looked at me like I crawled from a swamp
    D		   Bm
Now things have a different complexion
F#m		   G
I'm the object of your affection
F				  D
Much as I don't doubt your expertise
F				D  G  D7
Find yourself another hunk to squeeze

Chorus:
           G   Bm           Em
Cause it's too late to come fishing
     C   Bm           D7
It's too late to come fishing
     G   Bm           Em                   A7
It's too late and the fish don't like your bait
G		      D             A
Tin Pan Ellie better find your way home

I know I had the flair, the clothes
Made you look right down your nose
But now you want to make a new start
I'm so touched by your change of heart
But my diary's fit to overflow
Find yourself another gigolo

Chorus

I've seen your work in that TV sketch
Playing poison women is hardly a stretch
And you were type-cast as the Stone Age charmer
In that Darwin docudrama
I'd say our time has all but disappeared
Just like the shine on your fabulous career

Chorus
