...DOWN IN THE VALLEY... by Otis Redding
------------------------................

*from 'Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul' (1965)*


Verse 1:

(n.C)        Bb                           F
 Down in the valley, ha, in the valley so low,
Hang your hair over your shoulder,
                                Bb
And you can hear the four winds blow.

Bb
 Now can't you hear the wind blow, my love?
                        F
Can't you hear the wind blow? Ha, ha,
                                               G
We're down in the valley, ha, in the valley so low, now, ha!

Verse 2:

Bb
 Now have you ever been lonely, lonely?
                       F
Now have you ever been sad?
Did you ever really need someone, oh my,
                                Bb
Who really needed; fa-fa-fa fa, fa-fa-fa.

Bb
 Gotta, gotta, gotta, ha, too much, ooh yeah, help me baby,
F                             Bb
 Gotta get the groove, so too much, ooh yeah.

Verse 3:

Bb                                           F
 It was down in the valley, in the valley so low,
It was when I held you so tight,
                       Bb
How can I ever let you go, go, go, go?

           Bb
Now it was down, down, down, down,
                                  F
Down, down, down in the valley so low,
                                                      Bb
When I held you so tight, now; how can I ever let you go, now?
