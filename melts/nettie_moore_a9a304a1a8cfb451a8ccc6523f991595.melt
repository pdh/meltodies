Verse:
Em        G/F#         G
Lost John sittin' on a railroad track
Bbd56            Am
Somethings outta wack
Em         G/F#             G         Am7
Blues this morining falling down like hail
G                    D    G
Gonna leave a greazy trail

repeat pattern

Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
Then come back and see you
All I ever do is struggle and strive
I don't do anybody any harm I might make it back home alive

I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
I'm in a cowboy band
I got a pile of sins to pay for and I aint got time to hide
I'd walk through a blazing fire baby if I knew you was on the other side

Chorus:
D  C G
Oh I miss you Nettie Moore
C
And my happines is over
D                                G
Winters gone, the river's on the rise
                          B7
I loved you then and ever shall
            C                  G
But there's no-one left in our town
                   D               G
The world has gone black before my eyes


And that's it! Just keep repeating for verses and chorus
