Strumming, all open chords:


G                       Em
I've been searching the whole darn day
C                       G
For the little woman of mine, mine, mine, mine!
G                       Em
Someone told me I could find her here,
        C - D          G
but it seems she dissappear.

G                       Em
I've been searching the whole darn day,
C                G
Night is drawing nigh,
G           Em
I think I'd better go home,
C -     D      G
Try tomorrow again.

G                 Em
When I reach that railroad station
C                 G          G7
I missed the last train, and then it
C          G        C             G
Seems like dewdrops gonna fall on me. Yes, it
C          G          C  -   D      G
seems like tear drops gonna call on me, now.

G                    Em
Said I'd better make up my mind,
C               G
What am I gonna do-hoo-hoo-hoo?
G          Em
Am I gonna rest up here
   C          D       G
Or am I gonna push on through?

G                        Em
My mind said hey man you hit the road!
C                       G
Down there I missed the track, track, track,
G         Em                  C              D     G         G7
I'm lost! Lord I'm lost yeah, love is such a heavy load, and then,

C                    G
For crying out loud, come back to me,
C                    G
For crying out loud, hear my plea,
C                    G            Em
For crying out loud, come back to me-
G                        Em
Why do you treat me so bad,
C          D           G
Why do you treat me so bad?

Fade out:
G - Em - C - G -

Peace out
