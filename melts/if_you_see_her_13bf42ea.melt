Verse 1:
      A                       D             A
	If you see her and she mentions my name
                                   D              E     
	Tell her the times have but i have not changed
     Bm                           A                D  
	All my friends know that i still feel the same
      A                       E             A   
	If you see her and she mentions my name


Verse 2:
      A               D             A  
	If you see her ask her for me
                              D              E  
	If the dreamer in her ever set her free
     Bm                             A            D     
	Does she know now what the words i sing mean
      A                         E             A   
	If you see her would you ask her for me


Chorus:
         D                               A  
	Everything i told her then was true
         D                          A
	Everything was true at the time
             D          E       D             E            
	But time has a way of changing everything
          D              E         
	The truth has a way of changing all the time


Verse 3:
      A                       D             A  
	If you see her and she mentions my name
                               D              E 
	Tell her for me that she was not to blame
     Bm                           A              D   
	There's no reason now for her to feel ashamed
      A                       E             A
	If you see her and she mentions my name


Chorus.
