Intro is F#m with a bit of a hammer on the low A note

#note# in-between sections the song finds it's grove by
reverting to F#m for a couple of bars.
As the song goes on, F#m stays for longer with slidey bits.
These can be slid between E--0--2--5  or B--2-5-7-10
                          A--0--2--5     G--2-4-6-9- 


Verse
     A            E 
In a cavern, in a canyon,
    Bm           F#m 
Excavating for a mine
        A           E
Dwelt a miner forty niner,
        D              F#m
And his daughter Clementine

          A              E
Light she was and like a fairy,
        Bm                F#m
And her shoes were number nine,
        A              E
Herring boxes, without topses,
        D               F#m
Sandals were for Clementine.


[Chorus:]
      A              F#m
Clementine, Clementine,
      A                  D
Oh my darling, Clementine!


Verse 
          A                E
Drove she ducklings to the water
      Bm              F#m
Ev'ry morning just at nine,
        A                     E 
Hit her foot there against a splinter,
       D              F#m  
Fell into the foaming brine.

     A              E  
Ruby lips above the water,
        Bm                F#m
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine,
      A             E  
But, alas, I was no swimmer,
     D             F#m
So I lost my Clementine.


[Chorus:]
      A              F#m
Clementine, Clementine,
      A                  D
Oh my darling, Clementine!


Verse 
         A       E
then the miner, 49er
       Bm              F#m
soon began to peak and pine
           A               E   
thought he aughta join his daughter
         D               F#m
now he's left with clementine

      A                     E
in my dreams she still does haunt me
       Bm                 F#m
broken garments soaked in brine
          A              E
though in life I used to hug her
   D                F#m  
in death i draw the line


[Chorus:]
      A              F#m
Clementine, Clementine,
      A                  D
Oh my darling, Clementine!


Verse 
      A                 E  
How I missed her! How I missed her,
      Bm              F#m  
How I missed my Clementine,
      A                 E
so I kissed her little sister,
         D            F#m 
and I forgot my Clementine.


[Chorus:]
      A              F#m
Clementine, Clementine,
      A                  D
Oh my darling, Clementine!
      A               F#m
clementine, clementine
         A                       D
you are lost and gone, Clementine
             F#m
clementine...


 [slide around in F#m!]


[Chorus:]
      A              F#m
Clementine, Clementine,
      A                  D
Oh my darling, Clementine!
      A              F#m
clementine, clementine
         A                       D
you are lost and gone, Clementine
