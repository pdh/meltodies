Rat in a drain ditch, Caught on a limb,
A                   B      E
You know better but I know him.

Like I told you, what I said,
Steal your face right off your head.

Now he's gone, now he's gone, Lord he's gone, he's gone.
       A                 B
Like a steam locomotive, rollin' down the track
     A           E              B         A          
E
He's gone, gone, nothin's gonna bring him back...He's gone.

Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride,
Hot as a pistol but cool inside.
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile,
Nothin' left to do but smile, smile, smile!!!!

Now he's gone, now he's gone Lord he's gone, he's gone.
Like a steam locomotive, rollin' down the track
He's gone, gone, nothin's gonna bring him back...He's gone.

B               D                  A
Goin' where the wind don't blow so strange,
B                 D                  A
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain.
D                      A            G
Lost one round but the prize wasn't anything,
  D            Dm       A           B
A knife in the back and more of the same.

Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb,
You know better but I know him.
Like I told you, what I said,
Steal your face right off your head.

Now he's gone, now he's gone Lord he's gone, he's gone.
Like a steam locomotive, rollin' down the track
He's gone, gone, nothin's gonna bring him back...He's gone.

Ooh, nothin's gonna bring him back.
