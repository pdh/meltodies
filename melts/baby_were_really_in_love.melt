If you're loving me like I'm loving you
                     D7
Baby we're really in love
 
If you're happy with me like I'm happy with you
                         G
Old Cupid just gave us a shove 
                   
If you're thinking of me like I'm thinking of you
                                 D7
Then I know what you're thinking of
 
If you're loving me like I'm loving you
                      G   G7
Baby  we're really in love     
 
  C             G
I run around in circles
G7   C            G    G7
And turn in fire alarms
    C                G
I'm nutty as a fruit cake
     A7               D7
When you're not in my arms
    G
If you're meant for me like I'm meant for you
                   D7
Baby we fit like a glove
 
If you're loving me like I'm loving you
                     G
Baby we're really in love 
 
 
If you're loving me like I'm loving you
                     D7
Baby we're really in love
 
If you're counting on me like I'm counting on you
                         G
Old Cupid just gave us a shove
 
If you're dreaming of me like I'm dreaming of you
                                 D7
Then I know what you're dreaming of
 
If you're loving me like I'm loving you
                      G   G7
Baby  we're really in love
 
   C                     G    G7
My folks think I've gone crazy
    C                G    G7
And I don't feel too sure
    C                         G
And yet there's nothing wrong with me
     A7                  D7
That wedding bells won't cure
   G
If you go for me like I go for you
                   D7
Baby we fit like a glove
 
If you're loving me like I'm loving you
                     G
Baby we're really in love
