FIRST WE TAKE MANHATTAN (Leonard Cohen)

        Dm                             Am
They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
       Dm                              Am
For trying to change the system from within
       Dm                       Am
I'm coming now I'm coming to reward   them
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

       Dm                        Am
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
       Dm                         Am
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
       Dm                         Am
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

    C                                G    F
I'd really like to live beside you, baby
              C                             Am
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
         C                                       Am
But you see that line there moving through the station
    G          F          E                      Am
I told you I told you I told you I was one of those

       Dm                              Am
You loved me as a loser but now your worried that I just might win
     Dm                             Am
You know the way to stop me but you don't have the discipline
     Dm                                Am
How many nights I prayed for this: to let my work begin
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

Dm                                   Am
I don't like your fashion business, mister
Dm                                      Am
I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
Dm                                  Am
I don't like what happened to your sister
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  (chorus)

       Dm                                Am
And I thank you for those items that you sent me
    Dm                         Am
The monkey end the plywood violin
    Dm                               Am
I practiced every night and now I'm ready
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

   Dm                            Am
Remember me, I used to live for music
   Dm                                  Am
Remember me, I brought your groceries in
       Dm                          Am
It's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
