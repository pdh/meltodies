C                     F                                         C
If We Make It Through December every thing's gonna be alright I know
                         Dm         G                              C
It's the coldest time of winter and I shiver when I see the falling snow
      C              F
If We Make It Through December
                                   C
Got plans to be a warmer town come summer time
               Dm
Maybe even California
G                                  C
If We Make It Through December we'll be fine
                        
                           Dm
Got laid off down at the factory
G                                          C
And their timing's not the greatest in the world
                    DM           G     Dm              G          C                C
Heaven knows I been working hard wanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girl
  C                 F
I don't mean to hate December
                                   C
It's meant to be the happy time of year  
                         Dm        G                             C                  C
And my little girl don't understand why daddy can't afford no Christmas here

                      F                                         C
If We Make It Through December every thing's gonna be alright I know
                         Dm     G                                    C
It's the coldest time of winter and I shiver when I see the falling snOW
      C              F
If We Make It Through December
                                   C
Got plans to be a warmer town come summer time
               Dm
Maybe even California
G                                     C
If We Make It Through December we'll be fine
