ROAD TO NOWHERE		TALKING HEADS


D			  Bm
We're on a road to nowhere, come on inside
D			   Bm
Taking that ride to nowhere, we'll take that ride
G			      D         A
I'm feelin' okay this morning, and you know
G			D	     A 		 D
We're on a road to paradise, here we go, here we go



We're on a ride to nowhere, come on inside
Taking that ride to nowhere, we'll take that ride
Maybe you'll wonder where you are, I don't care
Here is where time is on our side, take you there, take you there

D			   Bm
We're on a road to nowhere, ha   -  ha
We're on a road to nowhere, ha   -  ha

  	   D
There's a city in my mind come along and take that ride
	    Bm
And it's alright, baby it's alright
	  D
And it's very far away, but it's growin' day by day 
	   Bm
And it's alright, baby it's alright
	   D
Would you like to come along, you can help me sing this song
	   Bm
And it's alright, baby it's alright


Chorus
