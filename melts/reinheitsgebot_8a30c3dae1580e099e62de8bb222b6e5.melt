Gospel Music feat. Darren Hayman from Hefner


C				F
Baby I've been brewing my own beer
C				F
I'd pour you a pint if you were still here
C				F
I know your new man's kind of a big deal
         G          			F
But I bet he don't brew his own beer

C				F
Baby I quit smoking those cigarettes 
C				F
If I could only get off this Nicorette
C				F
You know I only started because we met
G				F
Thanks for being a sport about my breath

C  F  G  F	     C  F  G  F
You didn't get the best of me
F			G
The best of me came after you
F				G
Now it's being wasted on someone new

C				F
Baby I've been cooking this gumbo
C				F
With okra, celery, peppers, quote-sausage-quote
C				F
It's a shame I never got to fix you a bowl
G				F
But maybe sometime later â€“ you never know


C				F
And babe I finally finished a marathon
C				F
Next year I'm trying to qualify for Boston
C				F
Remember all our hung-over morning runs?
G				       F
Well, without you the miles seem twice as long


Em			        F
I hear you finally found your sound
Em				F
Your low notes always fell to the ground
Em 				F                    G     A
I hear you finally found your sound second-hand

C  F  G  F	     C  F  G  F
You didn't get the best of me
F			G
The best of me came after you
F			G
Now it's being wasted on someone new
F			G
I'm wasted now with someone in lieu

C				F
Baby I've been brewing my own beer
C				F
I'd pour you a pint if you were still here
C				F
I know your new man's kind of a big deal
         G          			F
But I bet he don't brew his own beer
