What a great song by Cat Stevens (a.k.a. Yusuf Islam). This is definetly my favorite 
of his.

If you're like me, you clicked the Hard Headed Woman tab with the most stars for the 
first and got a bunch of numbers instead of easy chords.  Now, I didn't copy that guys tab, 
made my own, but mine is much easier to play along with because of just the letters of the chord.

(and if this tab works for you, please rate it to help other people know this one is best)

Enjoy.
