Here's a simple version of Bob Dylan's "Workingman's Blues #2" from the album "Modern 
Play the A as a bar chord in verses (sounds a little cleaner).

VERSE:

           A            E
There's an evening haze settlin over town
F#m                          D#m
starlight by the edge of the creek
    D                       A
The buyin power of the Proletariat's gone down
Bm                         E
money's gettin shallow and week
         A                      E
Well the place I love best is a sweet memory
       F#m                   C#m
it's a new path that we trod
         D                  A
They say low wages are reality
      Bm                   E
if we want to compete abroad
A                          E
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
     F#m              C#m
come sit down on my knee
        D                   A
You are dearer to me than myself
   Bm                  E
as you yourself can see
         A                      E
Well I'm listening to the steel rails hum
F#m                  C#m
got both eyes tight shut
     D                             A
Just sittin here tryin to keep the hunger from
Bm                       E
creepin it's way into my gut


CHORUS:

D                           A
Meet me at the bottom don't lag behind
Bm                    E
bring me my boots and shoes
        D                            A
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Bm                         E              A
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
