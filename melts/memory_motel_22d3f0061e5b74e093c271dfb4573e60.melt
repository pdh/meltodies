                          MEMORY MOTEL
                         ROLLING STONES

YOU CAN CAPO AND CHANGE THE KEYS BUT KEEP THE STANDARD OPEN CHORD SHAPES ITS EASIER.
Add the G bass to the C chord for a fuller sound. Remeber its a bout an ocean location
so let the note ring (spray) out.

INTRO:   G  Em  C  Am -- 2x's


VERSE:
     G                  Em
      Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl
     C                           Am
      Her eyes were hazel and her nose was slightly curved
     G                         Em
      We spent a night at the Memory Motel
     C                      Am
      It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well
     G                            Em
      It took a starry night to steal my breath away
     C                             Am                       G  Em  C  Am
      Down on the waterfront, her hair all drenched in spray




CHORUS:
     G              Em      C                Am
      You're just a memory   of a love that used to be
     G              Em      C 
      You're just a memory   of a love
            Am                        G Em C Am 
      That used to mean so much to me


BREAK:
      C          C/B           G           D      G      C  G
      She got a mind of her own and she use it well, yeah
      Well, she's one of the kind
