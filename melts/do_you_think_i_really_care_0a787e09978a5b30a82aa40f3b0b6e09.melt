              DO YOU THINK I REALLY CARE (YELLOW CAB)
                         ROLLING STONES

INTRO: D G    D  G

Here I come... 

VERSE:
D                    G
Do you think I could ever care
A                   G      D
'Bout a girl, who's never there?
D                    G
Do you think I could ever care
A                  G      D
'Bout a girl who's never there?

CHORUS:
D
I saw her on the subway
               E
Saw her on the D-train
G
Saw her in the afternoon
A
After all the Giants' games
                D
Saw her on the freeway
              E
Saw her on a highway
G                              A
Gimme a break, I need a Yellow Cab
Help me get outta this rain 

VERSE:
Do you think I could ever care
'Bout a girl who's almost never there?
Do you think the clothes she wears
Would change my mind
Or turn my hair?

CHORUS:
I saw her on a freeway
Saw her on a A-train
Saw her hangin' out
On 52nd and Broad
Saw her on a highway
Saw her on a skyway
Ahhhh, need a Yellow Cab, Ronnie
Let me get outta the rain 

INSTRUMENTAL:  D  G  A  G  D - 3x's
Yeah......g'head
Good job
Yeah! 

CHORUS:
I saw her on a highway
On A D-train
I saw her eatin' a pizza
On 75th and Broadway
Saw her on a subway
On a biplane
Ahh, I'm getting tired o' this shit
I need a Yellow Cab
Help me get outta this rain 

VERSE (Play verse chords to fade out):
Do you think I could ever care
'Bout a girl who's almost never there?
Do you think ......could ever care
'Bout a girl who cares about the...the clothes she wears?
Do you think I could ever care
'Bout a girl that even dyes her hair? 

The song
Do you think
Whooo
Oh no
Whooo 

Ohhh, do you think I would really care
'Bout a woman......who's never there?
Do you think I'd ever care
'Bout a woman....the clothes she wears? 

'Bout a girl who's hardly ever there?
Whooo! Whooo!
Well, that's alright
Whooo
