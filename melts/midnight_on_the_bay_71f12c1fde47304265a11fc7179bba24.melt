Song: midnight on the bay


     Dmaj7
It’s midnight on the bay and lights are shinin’
            Amaj7     A       Amaj7  A
And the the sailboats sway
         Dmaj7
And that cool ocean breeze.  Blowin’ down from the keys
             Amaj7     A       Amaj7  A
I think I’ll call it a day.

Chorus
    C#              D     A          E       Dmaj7
Oh, midnight on the bay.  Sure feels good to me.
    C#              D     A          E       Dmaj7
Oh, midnight on the bay.  Sure feels good to me.

2nd verse
What’s this I see there’s someone comin’
Walkin’ right up to me.
She tells me, “I know you name
And if it’s all the same
I’d like to spend some time.
Chorus
And midnight on the bay. Sure feels good to me.
Oh, midnight on the bay.  Sure feels good to me.

3rd verse
And now it’s midnight on the bay lights are shinin’
On the sailboats that sway.
In the cool ocean breeze blowin’ down from the keys
I think I’ll call it a day.
Chorus
Oh, midnight on the bay.  Sure feels good to me.
Oh, midnight on the bay.  Sure feels good to me.
