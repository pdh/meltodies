'Banks of The Ohio' (Trad.)
Recorded by Johnny Cash, to be found on 'American Recordings Unearthed'
originally recorded by Billie and Charlie Monroe in 1936. 
Words sung by Mr Cash somewhat different from Monroe's.
Anyway, my favourite johnny song. 

Intro: G

1st verse:
           G               D
I asked my love, to take a walk
                      G
Take a walk, just a little ways,
                            C
And as we walked, along  we talked
              G    D            G
Of when would be,   our wedding day.

Chorus:
         G                   D 
And only say, that you'll be mine,
                         G
In no o  thers arms entwined,
                             C
Down beside where the waters flow,
            G    D          G
Down by the banks of the Ohio.

Verse 2:
            G              D
I asked her if she'd marry me,
                    G
And my wife forever be,
                          C
She only turned her head away
           G  D           G
And had no other words to say.

Chorus.

verse 3:
            G              D
I plunged a knife into her breast,
                              G
And told her she was going to rest,
                                   C
She cried 'Oh Willie, don't murder me,
        G       D           G 
I'm not prepared for eternity.'

verse 4 :

           G             D 
I took her by her golden curls,
                              G
And drug her down to the riverside,
                            C 
And there I pushed her into drown,
                  G D            G
And I watched her as she floated down.

Chorus.

Verse 5 :
          G                       D
And going home between twelve and one,
                                G
And cried 'Oh Lord, What have I done,
                            C
I've killed the only girl I love,
            G    D          G
Because she would not marry me.

Chorus.
