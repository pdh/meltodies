Song: Troubador


    C                         F              C
The Troubador, the Troubador, sings from his heart
    G7                         C    G7
the song that's the hit of the show
C                                   F        C
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar
 G7                             C
Alone in the bright spotlight's glow
    F                       C
The song is for someone he loved so true
    F                             C      G7 
who loved him, then left him for someone new
    C                         F            C
The Troubador, the Troubador, smiles as he sings
    G7                       C
But his heart is breaking in two


Instrumental break

     C                            F          C
They beg for more, the Troubador, sings once again
    G7                         C    G7
the song that's the hit of the show
C                                   F         C
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar
 G7                             C
Alone in the bright spotlight's glow
 F                     C
There is a hush in the darkened hall
  F                         C         G7
A few hearts are heavy, and teardrops fall
    C                               F             C
But in the crowd, one head is bowed for the Troubador
  G7                            C
Because her heart aches most of all
C                      G7                     C
Troubador, Troubador, her heart aches most of all
