 Alabama : Harvest 

 F G Em7 F G F C F G Em7
                     

 F G     Em7   F         G              F         C     
 O h  Alabama; the devil fools with the best laid plans.

 F     G   Em7    
 Swing low Alabama

 F                     D                      
 You got spare change, you got to feel strange

 E                  F           G        
 And now the moment is all that it meant.

 Chorus:
 Am7                                          
 Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders

         C             D    
 That's  breaking your back.

      Am7                                  
 Your cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch

       C            D    
 And a wheel on the track

                                                    
 Oh Alabama, Banjos playing through the broken glass
 Windows down in Alabama.
 See the old folks tied in white ropes
 Hear the banjo; don't it take you down home?

 Chorus
                                               
 Oh Alabama; can I see you and shake your hand.
 Make friends down in Alabama.
 I'm from a new land
 I come to you and see all this ruin 
 What are you doin'? 

 Am7     
 Alabama,

                                  C         D   
 You got the rest of the union to help you along

        Am7          F G Em7    
 What's goin' wrong?      (hold)
