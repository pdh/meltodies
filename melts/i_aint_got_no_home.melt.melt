C                   F                          C
I ain't got no home, I'm just a-ramblin' 'round,
C                                  D               G
A hard working ramblin' man, and I go from town to town.
C                   F               
police make it hard  wherever I may go
    C                           G        C
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

[C          F  C            F        C]
I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
