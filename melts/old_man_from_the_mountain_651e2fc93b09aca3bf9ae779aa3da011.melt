Chorus
G                                    C
The old man from the mountains comin' home home home
G                               D
Thought I better warn ye, so I called you on the phone
G                           C
Get rid of Joe the grinder, better be there alone
G                          D                G
cause the old man from the mountains comin' home

Same chord progression for all verses.
