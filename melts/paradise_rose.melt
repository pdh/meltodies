Waylon Jennings "Paradise Rose" or "Rose in Paradise"

I posted this on Sept 18th 2010. 
As of this date NO ONE has posted the chords or tab 
for this song properly. I'm no music theorist, but this 
is the way it's done...

Verse 1
D                         C
She was a flower for the takin'
G                          D
Her beauty cut just like a knife.
D                   C    
He was a banker from Macon. 
G                              D
He swore he'd love her all his life.

Verse 2
D                             C
He bought her mansion up on a mountain,
G                                D 
With a floral garden and alot of land.
D                       C
But paradise became her prison
G                                    D
That Georgia banker was a jealous man

Chorus
Bm                       G
And Every time he talked about her
Bm                           G    A
You could see the fire in his eyes  

...and he'd say...

D                            C
I would walk through hell on Sunday
G                          D
To keep my rose in paradise

verse 3
He hired a man to tend the garden
And keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say that gardener left alone

Verse 4
Now that banker He's an old man
That mansions crumblin' down
He sits all day and stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found

Chorus

Verse 5
Now there's a rose out in the garden
It's beauty cuts just like a knife
Some say it even grows in the winter time
and blooms in the dead of the night

I like to repeat the chorus again at the end, but Waylon doesn't do it this a way. Enjoy.
