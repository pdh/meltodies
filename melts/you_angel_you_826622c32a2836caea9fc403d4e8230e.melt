C   F     C
You angel you
            F          C
You got me under your wing
             Em           F       G
The way you walk and the way you talk
   F            G      C
I feel I could almost sing
 
You angel you
You're as fine as anything's fine
I just want to watch you talk
With your memory of my mind  

        F                                    C
And Lord, I can't sleep at night for trying
                  Em        F     G
Yes, I never did feel this way before
 C         Em         F        G
Never did get up and walk the floor
    C       Em         F                G
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more      
You angel you,
You're as fine as can be
The way you walk and the way you talk
Is the way it ought to be 

Instrumental

Chorus
 
You angel you

Chorus
