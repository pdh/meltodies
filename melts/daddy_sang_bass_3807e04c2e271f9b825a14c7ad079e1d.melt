Johnny Cash  - Daddy Sang Bass

     E
I remember when I was a lad
            A                    E
Times were hard and things were bad
                                           B7
But there's a silver linin' behind every cloud
           E
Just poor people that all we were
                  A                       E
Tryin' to make a livin' out of blackland earth
                                   B7             E
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud. ...


CHORUS:
                            E7
Daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor
                A                       E
Me and little brother would join right in there
                                  B7
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul
              E
One of these days and it won't be long
        A             E
I'll rejoin them in a song
                           B7             E
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne. ...
                          E7
No, the circle won't be broken
         A                 E
Bye and bye, Lord, bye and bye ...
                                  E7
Daddy'll sing bass, mama'll sing tenor
                A                     E
Me and little brother will join right in there
                  B7       E  E   B7   E
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

         E                            A              E
Now I remember after work mama would call in all of us
                                         B7
You could hear us singin' for a country mile
             E                                  A             E
Now little brother has done gone on but I'll rejoin him in a song
                            B7                  E
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while.


CHORUS
