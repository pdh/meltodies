                          JOHNNY CASH

WHOLE SONG :      A    E   F#m   D   (PLAYED OVER AND OVER)

Jesus I don't wanna die alone Jesus oh Jesus I don't wanna die alone
My love wasn't true Now all I have is you
Jesus oh Jesus I don't wanna die alone
Jesus If you hear my last breath Don't leave me here Left to die a lonely
death I know I have sinned but Lord I'm suffering
Jesus Oh Jesus If you hear my last breath
Jesus I don't wanna die alone Jesus oh Jesus I don't wanna die alone
My love wasn't true Now all I have is you
Jesus Oh Jesus I don't wanna die alone
Jesus Jesus All my troubles All My pain Will leave me Once again
All my troubles All my pain Will leave me once again
All my troubles All my pain Will leave me once again Once again
