TITLE         : When You Dance I Can Really Love
WRITTEN BY    : Neil Young
PERFORMED BY  : Neil Young
ALBUM         : After The Gold Rush (1970)

GUITAR CHORDS : Dsus=xx0233, D=xx0232,   C=332010,   G*=320003,
                D5=00235,    Dm7=xx0211, Am7=x02010, Bb*=x03331                
   Bar Chords : F=133211,    G=355433,   Bb=688766

INTERPRETED BY: Monsty

Notes :-
#1 Dm7   : You can play an "F" chord if you wish
          - there's not much difference. 
#2 Slide : the Bar chord up (e.g. F to G) before striking G
#3 Bb    : Play the "Open String" inversion 
           + play the 5th string "open" to get a dis-chord sound
             then it easily drops down to Am7

When playing Instrumental_Parts :-

Dsus &amp; D5 should be struck 3 times each
D is struck 3 times in 1st part but only 2 times in 2nd part
C, G &amp; Bb are only played once each

Additionally :- 
C : just play the 5th,4th,3rd strings in sequence
    - don't sound the whole chord.
G : Play "Open String" chord inversion on the 1st line
    Play the Bar inversion on the 2nd line
