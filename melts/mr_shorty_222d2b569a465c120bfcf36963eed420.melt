Mr.  Shorty
By Marty Robbins

Transcribed by Shane Roe (with help from the earlier version)

Each verse follows the same pattern, until the end. There is a slight change in the 
from the rest of the verses and I've noted the change within the last line. This is a great 
nearly forgotten song. I hope I did well on my first tab submission. Enjoy it!

(C) Slowly he walked to the (Am) end of the bar and (D) he ordered one slug of (E) Gin
Well I could (Am)see he wasn't a (D)large man I could (G)see he wasn't too (E)tall
(C)I judged him to be a (Am) bout five foot three and his (D)voice was a soft Texas (G)Drawl
