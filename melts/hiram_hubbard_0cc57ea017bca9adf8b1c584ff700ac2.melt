VERSES

1. Oh they took him, cross the mountains and they wooped him on the hill
Oh they took him, across the mountains and they wooped him on the hill
It was there that he pleaded oh please let me make my will

CHORUS:

2. They took him down to Danville and they throwed him in jail
Oh they took him down to Danville and they throwed him in jail
And it was then nobody saw him, nobody could go his way

CHORUS:

3.They took him out at midnight and they strapped him to a tree
Oh they took him out at midnight and they strapped him to a tree
It was there that they killed him, with a rifle’s bullits three
