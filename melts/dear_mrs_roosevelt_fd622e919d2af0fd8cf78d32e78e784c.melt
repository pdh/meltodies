DEAR MRS. ROOSEVELT - BOB DYLAN



The audible guitar part seems to play with the following set of barre chords throughout,
raised a semitone (one fret) for the verses marked with an indent. If you don't feel
like using the suggested chords, I indicate the chords for the raised verses:

E    x76454    F    F#   G
A    577655    Bb   B    C    
G#m  466444    Am   A#m  Bm
B    799877    C    C#   D

The last verse reverts to the original position.
Verses not sung by Dylan and the Band are written in italics.

E                                                  E7
Dear Mrs Roosevelt, don't hang your head and cry.
A                                                            E
His mortal flesh*) is laid away, but his good work fills the sky.    
     G#m       B                E
This world was lucky to see him born.
