Well, I'm a lonesome schoolboy and I just came into town

                 Ebm                                    Bbm
Yeah, I'm a lonesome schoolboy and I just came into town
        F7                        Ebm                       Bbm
Well, I heard so much about London I decided to check it out
 
 

        Bbm
Well, I wait in Leicester Square where the guy never looks in my eye
          Ebm                                                   Bbm
Yeah, I'm leaning on Nelsons Column but all I do is talk to the lime

 

 

   F7

Oh where can I get my cock sucked, where can I get my arse fucked

  Bbm                       F7                              Bbm

I ain't got no money, but I know where to put it every time

 

 

 

Well, I asked a young policeman if he'd only lock me up for the night
Well, I've had pigs in the farmyard... some of them, some of them are alright
Well, he fucked me with his truncheon and his helmet was way too tight
