Valerie

Run For The Roses

(Garcia/Hunter)


A                                        E
Hey Valerie, Baby what's the matter with you?

A                                          E
I did all of the things that you wanted me to



Bm walk up



Bm                      A      E
I went downtown with my pocket knife,

Bm                        A          E
Cut your other man, but I spared his life

Bm            A              E
Valerie won't you be good to me?



Hey Valerie, Baby what's the matter with you?

Come on, come Baby, and tell me true

Hey now Baby, what did I do?

I shot my dog 'cause he growled at you

Valerie won't you be good to me?



B                              E
Valerie what's the matter with me?

  A                      E
I never ever done you no wrong

B                       E         A
I sing the blues nearly all night long.

B                            E
Valerie what the matter with me?

             A                      E
You know I'd do anything that you'd say

Bm                         A                   E
I can't understand why you tell me "Please go 'way"



I ain't afraid of the cold, cruel world outside

No chicken little running from a falling sky

The only thing trouble's me is you.

If you leave me what will I do?

Valerie won't you be good to me?



You got me down on the knees of my shaking feet

Can't play the blues 'cause for you I drop the beat

Valerie what your complaint?

I try to be everything I ain't

Valerie won't you be good to me?
