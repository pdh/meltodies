G                       B7 
All of me, why not take all of me? 
 
Em           B+            Bm7/5-   E7   
Can't you see, I'm no good without you.

Take my arms -- I want to lose them;

Take my lips -- I'll never use them. 
 
G                           B7 
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry, 
 
Em         B+             Bm7/5-   E7 
And I know   I'm no good without you. 
 
C             Cm       G    G/F#     E7 
You took the part that once was my heart,

    C            D  D7  2. G       A7    Am7      G  
So why not take all of     me?
