When the Man Comes Around- Johnny "The Real King" Cash
-------------------------------------------------------

Tabbed by: Micheal Edsall_Cruz
Email:redtrailrunner@hotmail.com

Tuning: I don't know, but the guitar is in standard tuning. 
Sorry, I can't read music and I know nothing of music theory.

chords are
      EADGBe
C1   (332010)
Am   (X02210)
F    (133211)
G    (320001)
C2   (X32010)
C3   (X32013)

Ok, so here goes.  C1 is a muted chord you just have to listen to the song
to hear the pattern. I know there are at least two guitars in this song but
this is just how I figured it out for one and it sounds ok to me.
I definitely would like any kind of feedback on this as this is my
VERY first tab work.

Enjoy!  Johnny Cash is and forever shall be "THE MAN"

 Ok, for the rest of the song you can basically listen and figure
out the changes the pickings are all the same.  Here's the lyrics
with the chords.


           THIS IS SPOKEN
And I heard as it were the noise of thunder.  One of the four 
beasts saying, "Come and see".  and I saw and behold a white horse

 C1
 there's a man goin' round takin' names and he decides who to free
 
and who to blame everybody will be treated all the same  
                                         Am  F    G
there'll be a golden ladder reaching down       when the 

man comes around

   C1 
   the hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each sip 

and in each sup  will you partake of that last offered cup?  or
                                   Am  F   G
or disappear onto the potter's ground

    CHORUS
 C2                                 C3      C2
   hear the trumpets hear the pipers        one hundred million &lt;BR&gt;
              C3  C2
angels singing    multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum&lt;BR&gt;
  G
  voices calling voices crying some are born and some are dying
                              C1(nm)  F
its alpha and omega's kingdom come     and the whirlwind is in the
           C1                                        F
thorn tree the virgins are all trimming their wings  the

whirlwind is in the thorn tree
C1
its hard for thee to kick against the pricks til armegeddon no

shalom no shalome then the father hen will call his chickens home

the wise men will bow down before the throne and at his feet
                                Am  F   G
they'll cast their golden crowns      when the man comes around
C1
whoever is unjust let him be unjust still whoever is righteous

let him be righteous still whoever is filthy let him be filthy
                                           Am  F    G
still listen to the words long written down       when the

man comes around

   CHORUS
C1
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks in measured hundred
                     Am  F    G                     C1(nm)
weight and paid pound      when the man comes around

  THIS IS SPOKEN..
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts and i looked
and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death,
and Hell followed with him

The final C chord ends with a  strong down up
