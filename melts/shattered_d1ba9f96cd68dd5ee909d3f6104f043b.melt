Verse 1:

E          B
Shattered, shattered
A          
Love and hope and sex and dreams
    B                             
Are still surviving on the street
E          A                  FIG 1
Look at me - I'm in tatters!
B
I'm a shattered.
Shattered 

Like Verse 1:
Friends are so alarming
And my lover's never charming
Life's just a cocktail party - on the street
Big Apple
People dressed in plastic bags
Directing traffic Some kind of fashion
Shattered 

A                                  B
Laughter, joy, and loneliness and sex and
sex and sex and sex
E          A                       E
Look at me - I'm in tatters I 'm a shattered
B
Shattered 

All this chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter,
chitter-chatter 'bout
Shmatta, shmatta, shmatta -- I can't give it
away on 7th Avenue
This town's been wearing tatters
(shattered, shattered)

A          
Work and work for love and sex
B                             E
Ain't you hungry for success, success,
  
success, success
A                 E
Does it matter? (Shattered) Does it
matter?
B
I'm shattered. Shattered

Ahhh, look at me - I'm a shattered
I'm a shattered
Look at me - I'm a shattered, yeah 

Pride and joy and greed and sex
That's what makes our town the best
Pride and joy and dirty dreams and still
surviving on the street
and look at me - i'm in tatters, yeah
I've been battered, what does it matter
Does it matter, uh-huh
Does it matter, uh-huh, I'm a shattered 

Don't you know the crime rate is going up,
up, up, up, up!
To live in this town you must be tough,
tough, tough, tough, tough!
You got rats on the west side
Bed bugs uptown
What a mess this town's in tatters I've been
shattered
My brain's been battered - splattered - all
over Manhattan 

Uh-huh, This town's full of money grabbers
Go ahead
Bite the Big Apple, don't mind the
maggots, huh
Shadoobie, My brain's been battered
My friends they come around they
Flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter, flatter,
flatter!
Pile it up, pile it high on the platter
