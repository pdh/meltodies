Satisfied Mind chords
Johnny Cash (Red Hayes and Jack Rhodes)

A

A        D     E        E7            A
How many times have you heard someone say?
             E    E7       D            A
if I had his money I could do things my way
                E   E7         D          A
But little they know that it's so hard to find
                E  E7      D         A
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.

A          D   E      E7          A
Once I was winning in fortune and fame
                  E          E7         D               A
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game,
                 E       E7  D          A
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime.
                  E  E7      D         A
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

            D   E         E7                A
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
                        E     E7    D                 A
or A friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold.
               E     E7    D         A
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
                E  E7      D         A
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

                E    E7       D            A
When my life is ended, and my time has run out
                  E    E7         D                A
My friends and my loved ones will weep, there's no doubt.
                  D   E            E7       A
But one thing for certain, when it comes my time
                E        E7      D         A
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

A        D     E        E7            A
How many times have you heard someone say?
             E    E7       D            A
if I had his money I could do things my way
                E   E7         D          A
But little they know that it's so hard to find
                E  E7      D         A    E E7 A
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
