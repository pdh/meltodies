~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Loving Cup		by Jagger/Richards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

D                  C                 G
I'm the man on the mountain, come on up
D                      C                          G
I'm the plowman in the valley with a face full of mud
         C                                   G
Yes I am fumbling and I know my car won't start
         C                                   G
Yes I am stumbling and I know I play a bad guitar

F              C                        G        
Give me little drink from your loving cup
F        C                            G
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk

	[repeat previouss chord pattern]
I'm the man who walks the hillside in the sweet summer sun
I'm the man who brings you roses when you ain't got none
Well, I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight
You if you want to push and pull with me all night

	[repeat previous chord pattern]
Give me little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk

Bm        Am                    G                     D
I feel so humble with you tonight just sitting by the fire
Bb
See your face dancing in the flame, feel your mouth kissing me again
Bb                                      D
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz
                 C                      G
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz
D                        C                      G
Ohhhhh, what a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz

          C                               G
Yes, I am nitty gritty and my shirt's all torn
            C                                     G
But I would love to spill the beans with you till dawn

	[repeat previous chord pattern]
Give me little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk

G
Gimme little drink (repeat a few times...)

D                         C                      G
Ohhhhhh, what a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz (repeat 2 or 3 times..)
