                        WAYFARING  STRANGER
                            JOHNNY CASH

INTRO:  Am  Dm  Am

VERSE:
      Am
      I'M JUST A POOR
      WAYFARING STRANGER
                   Dm
      TRAVELLING THROUGH
                   Am
      THIS WORLD BELOW
      THERE IS NO SICKNESS
      NO TOIL, NOR DANGER
                      Dm
      IN THAT BRIGHT LAND
                 Am
      TO WHICH I GO

CHORUS:
                  F
      I'M GOING THERE
                 C
      TO SEE MY FATHER
                  F
      AND ALL MY LOVED ONES
                  E  E7 E
      WHO'VE GONE ON
                Am
      I'M JUST GOING OVER JORDAN
                Dm         Am
      I'M JUST GOING OVER HOME

INSTRUMENTAL:   Am  Dm  Am      Am  Dm  Am

VERSE:
      I KNOW DARK CLOUDS
      WILL GATHER ROUND ME
      I KNOW MY WAY
      IS HARD AND STEEP
      BUT BEAUTIOUS FIELDS
      ARISE BEFORE ME
      WHERE GOD REDEEMS
      THERE VIDUALS KEEP

CHORUS:
      I'M GOING BACK
      TO SEE MY MOTHER
      SHE SAID SHE'D MEET ME
      WHEN I COME
      SO I'M JUST GOING OVER JORDAN
      I'M JUST GOING OVER HOME
      I'M JUST GOING OVER JORDAN
                           Am -- end dead on this chord
      I'M JUST GOING OVER HOME
