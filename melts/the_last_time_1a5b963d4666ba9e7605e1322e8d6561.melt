A                     E7               A
     Darlin', the seasons are changing;
                       E7                       A
See, now, the leaves, how they      die.
                        E7             A
Love needs no reason for ending.
                         E7              A       A7
Come kiss your baby good-bye.

D                                                                         A7
    Darlin', the last time you lied, was it really the last time?
                                                                                      D
Have all the tears that you've cried simply dried up and gone?
                                                                       A7
All in the world you can hurt anymore is my feelings.
                                                                 D             D7
Whatever love ever was never lasted too long.

G                                                                D
Maybe the best of our life was a beautiful dreaming.
         G                                                                            D
That conscience was destined to crumble like castles of sand.
G                                                              D
All there is left of our love is a little girl's laughter.
E7                                                                      A7
Let her keep makin' believin' as long as she can.

D                                                                         A7
Now and again I still hear some old song I don't want to.
                                                                                  D
Is it the same over there where you found your new friend?
                                                                                    A7
Sometimes at night I still wake up and feel somethin' missing.
                                                          D           D7
Maybe I'll never believe in forever a-gain.

G                D7             G
Darlin', the seasons are changing;
                       D7                       G
See, now, the leaves, how they die.
                       D7              G
Love needs no reason for ending.
                         D7              G
Come kiss your baby good-bye.
