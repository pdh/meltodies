I am adding a little tab bit for the intro.  This includes the basic rhythm
of the chord progression and a simplified extract of the lead intro.  If you
play it like it's tabbed you'll look rather impressive, but it's really easy 
to play. enjoy! Note that all the chords are to be played as bar chords, or
even power chords (but that doesn't sound as good).

Cm        A#          G#    A# Cm        A#       G#    A#
 "There's too much confusion,    I can't get no relief.

 Businessmen, they drink my wine,  plowmen dig my earth,

  None of them along the line   know what any of it is worth."

"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."

[repeat intro (only rhythm section]
[continue with the same chords as the first verse]

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl
