              Bird on the Wire by Leonard Cohen
              (from the CD Songs from a Room)

        A           E             A                   D
Like a bird on the wire, like a drunk in a midnight choir
         A          E              Asus4  A
I have tried in my way to be free
        A         E             A                             D
Like a worm on a hook, like a knight from some old-fashioned book
        A            E               Asus4  A
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
       D                         A
         If I, if I have been unkind
       Bm                                    A
         I hope that you can just let it go by
       D                          A
         If I, if I have been untrue,
       Bm                                 E
         I hope you know it was never to you.


Like a baby stillborn, like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song and by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
         I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
         He said to me, "You must not ask for so much."
         And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
         She cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more?"

        A           E             A                   D
Like a bird on the wire, like a drunk in a midnight choir
         A          E             D A
I have tried in my way to be free
