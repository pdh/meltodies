                              Pressing on
                             By: Bob Dylan


Chorus:x2
    G                   Dm
I'm Pressing on, I keep pressing on.
     C       G          Dm              Am    G
Yes pressing on, to the higher calling of my lord. 

Verse 1:
 D                                G     
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back
 D                               G         
Nothing now can hold you down, nothing that you lack
 D                                G               
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
  D                                 G                    
Because he sinned I got no choice, it run in my vein

Chorus:x2

Verse 2:
 D                      G
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind
 D                                   G
Say, "Prove to me that He is Lord, show me a sign" 
 D                            G 
What kind of sign they need, when it all come from within
 D                                G
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?

I tryed the Christien Bale version.
