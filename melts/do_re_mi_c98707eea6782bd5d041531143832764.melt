C                                     F
Lots of folks back East, they say, is leavin' home every day,
G                                               C
Beatin' the hot old dusty way to the California line.
                                   F              
'Cross the desert sands they roll, gettin' out of that old dust bowl,
     G                                                         C
They think they're goin' to a sugar bowl, but here's what they find 
         G
Now, the police at the port of entry say,

"You're number fourteen thousand for today." 

           C                                                      G
Oh, if you ain't got the do re mi, folks, you ain't got the do re mi,
                                                                             C
Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee.
                                                         F
California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see;
      C
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
                     G     C
If you ain't got the do re mi. 

C                                     F
You want to buy you a home or a farm, that can't deal nobody harm,
   G                                      C
Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea.
                                       F
Don't swap your old cow for a car, you better stay right where you are,
G                                C
Better take this little tip from me.
         G
'Cause I look through the want ads every day

But the headlines on the papers always say: 

           C                                                     G
Oh, if you ain't got the do re mi, boys, you ain't got the do re mi,
                                                                             C
Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee.
                                                         F
California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see;
      C
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
                     G     C
If you ain't got the do re mi.
