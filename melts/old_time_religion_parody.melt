E
Give me that old time religion
B7           E
Give me that old time religion
E            A
Give me that old time religion
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me

E
We will pray to Aphrodite
B7           E
Even tho' she's rather flighty
E            A
And they say she wears no nightie
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me

E
We will pray with those Egyptians
B7           E
Build pyramids to put our crypts in
E            A
Cover subways with inscriptions
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me

E
O-old Odin we will follow
B7           E
And in fighting we will wallow
E            A
Til we wind up in Valhalla
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me

E
Let me follow dear old Buddha
B7           E
For there is nobody cuter
E            A
He comes in plaster, wood, or pewter
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me

E
We will pray with Zarathustra
B7           E
Pray just like we useta
E            A
I'm a Zarathustra booster
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me

E
We will pray with those old Druids
B7           E
They drink fermented fluids
E            A
Waltzing naked thru the woo-ids
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me

E
Hare Krishna gets a laugh on
B7           E
When he sees me dressed in saffron
E            A
With my hair that's only half on
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me

E
I'll arise at early morning
B7           E
When my Lord gives me the warning
E            A
That the solar age is dawning
E          B7              E
And that's good enough for me
