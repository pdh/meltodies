C         C/B           Am        Am7/G      F
Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
C                         Am         Am7
I've got some real-estate here in my bag
Em                     A7              Em          A7
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner pies
    D      C      G        C    Am  Am7  F
And walked off to look for America

C       C/B         Am          Am7/G        F
Cathy I said as we boarded the Greyhound in Pittsburg
C        C/B          Am          Am7
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
G                                       Em   
It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw
    D    G       D         Cmaj7  C
And I've come to look for America

Bb                           C
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
Bb                      C                    Am C
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
F                     Fmaj7              C   Am C Am    F
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera

C                     Am            C         F
Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in my raincoat
C             C/B         Am   Am7
We smoked the last one an hour ago
Em                 A7       Em           A7      Em
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
        D    C    G       C    Am   C  F 
And the moon rose over an open field

C         C/B           Am        Am7/G       F
Cathy I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
    C         C/B          Am         Am7
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
G                                   Em
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
        D   G       D         Cmaj7
They've all come to look for America
        D   G       D         Cmaj7
They've all come to look for America
        D   G       D         Cmaj7  C
They've all come to look for America

C        Am  C     Dm  F G  G7
Do do do do-da-do, do do do do-da-do 2x
