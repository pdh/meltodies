Intro
F  Bbm  F  Bbm

Bbm     D#
Just a perfect day,
G#            C#
Drink Sangria in the park,
F#               D#m
And then later, when it gets dark,
      F
We go home.
Bbm     D#
Just a perfect day,
G#           C#
Feed animals in the zoo
F#          D#m
Then later, a movie, too,
         F
And then home.

   A#           D#
Oh it's such a perfect day,
    Dm                  D#    D#/D  C/Bb
I'm glad I spent it with you.
A#         F
Oh such a perfect day,
         Gm     F       D#
You just keep me hanging on,
         Gm     F       D#
You just keep me hanging on.


Just a perfect day,
Problems all left alone,
Weekenders on our own.
It's such fun.
Just a perfect day,
You made me forget myself.
I thought I was someone else,
Someone good.

Oh it's such a perfect day,
I'm glad I spent it with you.
Oh such a perfect day,
You just keep me hanging on,
You just keep me hanging on.
