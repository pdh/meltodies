             A        D                 A
Well hello there, It's been a long long time
           A    D               A
How ya doing, I guess I'm doing fine
A                       A7                 D         Bm
It's been so long and it seems that It was only yesterday
         E         D          A
Ain't it funny how time slips away?

                A       D                      A
How's your new love , I hope that he's doing fine
            A                   D                        A
I Heard you told him That you'd love him till the end of time
                    A              A7         D               Bm
Well now that's the same thing you told me it seems like yesterday
          E        D               A
Ain't it funny how time slips away?

              A          D                 A
I'm gonna go now and I Guess I'll see you around
                       D                                 A
But I Don't know when, don't know, when I'll be back in town
       A            A7               D                 Bm
But remember what I tell you That in time you're gonna pay
        E               D     E    A
Oh it's surprisin' how time slips away
        E               D     E    A
Oh it's surprisin' how time slips away
