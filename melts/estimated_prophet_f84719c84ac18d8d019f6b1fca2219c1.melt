F#m
My time coming, any day, dont worry about me, no
F#m
Been so long I felt this way, Im in no hurry, no
F#m
Rainbows and down that highway where ocean breezes blow
F#m
My time coming, voices saying they tell me where to go.

F#m
Dont worry about me, nah nah nah, dont worry about me, no
F#m
And Im in no hurry, nah nah nah, I know where to go.

G         C                  G             F  C
California, preaching on the burning shore
G         C                         G           F  C
California, I'll be knocking on the golden door
G            C               G              F
Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light
     C            G       F C                G   F  C
Then rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine.


My time coming, any day, dont worry about me, no
Its gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin slow
Still I know I lead the way, they tell me where I go.

Dont worry about me, no no no, dont worry about me, no
And Im in no hurry, no no no, I know where to go.

California, a prophet on the burning shore
California, Ill be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise, I know Im gonna shine.

G                                    C          G  F  C
Youve all been asleep, you would not believe me
G                                    C          G  F  C
Them voices tellin me, you will soon receive me
G                                  C
Standin on the beach, the sea will part before me
G          F              C
Fire wheel burning in the air!
G                              C      
You will follow me and we will ride to glory
G           F             C
Way up, the middle of the air!

Dm                            E
And Ill call down thunder and speak the same
Dm                    E
And my work fills the sky with flame
Dm                        E
And might and glory gonna be my name
Dm            F          Am
And men gonna light my way.

My time coming, any day, dont worry about me, no
Its gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin slow
My time coming, any day, dont worry about me, no

Dont worry about me, no no no, dont worry about me, no
And Im in no hurry, no no no, dont worry about me, no.
