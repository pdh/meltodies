Intro: C    F    C    G

       C                F               C     A

Well I don't know why I love you like I do

Dm                       G               C

Nobody in the world can get along with you.

                            F                    C     G

You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den

                           G                    C
Dm

I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in.

   F                          C

Oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be

Dm                            G       N.C.

When you get a crazy notion, jumpin' all over me

         C                   F                  C      G

Well you give me the blues because you're satisfied

Dm                           G                  C

An' you give me the blues I wanna lay down and die.

 

 

I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama

I helped you when you had no food to eat.

You're the kind of woman I just don't understand

You're takin' all my money and give it to another man.

Well you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brain

You're the kinda woman drives a man insane

You give me the blues because you're satisfied

You give me the blues I wanna lay down and die

Well you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die
