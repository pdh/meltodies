"Connection" (Jagger/Richards)
 From "Between the Buttons" (1967)
 
Intro: E   |F
               C  G                 C
All I want to do, is to get back to you
 E              E7                  F                               
Connection, I just can't make no connection
                  C   G                 C
But all I want to do is to get back to you.
 
 C              G             F       C
Everything is going in the wrong direction
       C              G              F
The doctor wants to give me more injections
 Am                     D              F
Giving me shots for a thousand rare infections
             C    G                 C
And I don't know if they'll let me go

Connection, I just can't make no connection.
But all I want to do is to get back to you.
Connection, I just can't make it, connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you.

My bags they get a very close inspection.
I wonder why it is that they suspect 'em
They're dying to add me to their collection
And I don't know if they'll let me go

Connection, I just can't make no connection.
But all I want to do is to get back to you.
Connection, I just can't make no connection.
But all I want to do is to get back to you.
