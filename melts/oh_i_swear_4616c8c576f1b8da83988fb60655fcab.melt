Oh I Swear 

      Bm          A           F#m
Oh, I swear and I swear and I swear
        G
That my heart’s not in it
      Bm         A         F#m
I can deadpan as dead as I can
       G
But my heart’s not in it
Em7                    Bm
What little of yours, what little of mine
    A          Bm
And we’ll get by

Like jailbirds locked in a cell
We go well together
Like a marriage arranged in hell
We go well together
Cruel poverty is the tie that binds
And we’ll get by

G              F#m
Can’t run in a dead end street
G              F#m
Can’t run in a dead end street
G         F#m
No wings upon your feet
Bm                   G
All your dreams are shackled to the ground (repeat)

And it couldn’t be love
And it couldn’t be love
Oh it couldn’t be love
Oh it couldn’t be love
What little of yours, what little of mine
And we’ll get by
