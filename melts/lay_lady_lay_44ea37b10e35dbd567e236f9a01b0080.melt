Normal tuning, however sometimes i put a capo on the fifth fret but still play the 
same chords, just an octave higher.
As for timing, just listen to the song a few times, it's just a basic 123 order. 

  G         Bm   F             Am        G   Bm   F   Am
 Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed

  G         Bm   F             Am        G   Bm   F   Am
 Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed

  Bm                      G
 Whatever colors you have in your mind

  Bm                              G
 I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine


  G           Bm    F             Am         G   Bm   F   Am
 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
 
  G                 Bm    F             Am          G   Bm   F   Am
 Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile

 Bm                              G     
 His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean

 Bm                                   G
 And you're the best thing that he's ever seen


  G           Bm    F             Am        G   Bm   F   Am
 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile 

 Bm                            G
 Why wait any longer for the world to begin

 Bm                                 G
 You can have your cake and eat it too

 Bm                           G
 Why wait any longer for the one you love

 Bm                              G
 When he's standing in front of you


  G         Bm    F            Am         G   Bm   F   Am
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed

  G           Bm    F               Am              G   Bm   F   Am
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead

  Bm                        G
 I long to see you in the morning light

  Bm                     G
 I long to reach for you in the night

  G           Bm     F              Am             G   Bm   F   Am
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
