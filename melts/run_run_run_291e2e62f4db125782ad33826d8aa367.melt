Teenage Mary said to uncle Dave
D
I sold my soul, must be saved
D
Gonna take a walk down Union Square
D
You never know who you're gonna find there
D
You gotta run run run run run
D
Take a drag or two
D
Run run run run run
D               G
Gypsy death and you
D
Tell you what' cha do


Marguarita passion, they had to get her fixed
She wasn't well, she was getting sick
Went to sell her soul, she wasn't high
Didn't know things she could buy

She would run run run run run
Take a drag or two
Run run run run run
Gypsy death and you
Tell you what' cha do

Seasick Sarah had a golden nose
Hobnail boots wrapped around her toes
When she turned blue all the angels screamed
They didh't know they could make the scene

She had to run run run run run
Take a drag or two
Run run run run run
Gypsy death and you
Tell you what' cha do

Beardless Harry what a waste
Couldn't even get a small town taste

Rode the trolley down to 47th
Figured it was good to get himself to heaven

Cos he had to run run run run run
Take a drag or two
Run run run run run
Gypsy death and you
Tell you what' cha do
