D                             G                 D 
Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing 
                                              A 
With a heavy heart, and my hat clutched in my hand 
               D              G                D 
Such a foolish man, God ain't known no greater sinner 
       G                 D                          D 
I have come in search of Jesus, hping he will understand 
 

                           G                       D 
If I give my soul, will he clean these clothes I'm wearin'? 
             G                                 A 
If I give my soul, will he put new boots on my feet? 
            D            G           D 
If I bow my head and beg God for his forgiveness 
        G                      D         A   
Will he breathe new breath within me and bring her back to  
D 
me? 
 

                            G                D 
I had a woman once, she was kind and she was gentle 
                                       A 
Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man                  
               D          G            D 
I had a steady job, til I started into drinkin' 
       G              D                A        
Then I started makin' music travellin' with the Devil's  
D 
band 
 

                  G                        D 
Oh the years went by like a mighty rush of eagles 
               G                               A 
Our dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind 
                    D              G                 D 
And it's a lonesome life, when you lose the ones you live  
 
for 
             G          D               A               
If I make my peace with Jesus, will she take me back  
 D 
again? 
 

             G                                D 
If I give my soul, will he stop my hands from shaking? 
             G                          A 
If I give my soul, will my son love me again? 
             D             G              D 
If I give my soul, and she knows I really mean it 
     G               D               A             D         
If I give my soul to Jesus, will she take me back again? 
 

             G                                   D 
If I give my soul, will he clean the clothes I'm wearin' 
             G                                 A 
If I give my soul, will he put new boots on my feet 
            D             G              D 
If I bow my head, and beg God for his forgiveness   
        G                      D         A            
Will he breathe new breath within me and bring her back to 
D 
me?
