Capo 2nd fret

     C          F     C   G7     C   G  E7      Am    E7      Am
     Many's the time I've been mistaken and many times confused
     C            F  C  G7   C   G   C B7 Am    E7        Am
     Yes and I've often felt forsaken and certainly misused
     C9         F   G         F   C             F  C  G  F  Am   A7
     Aw, but I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm just weary to my bones
     D7         G7                     C  G7  D       G
     Still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant
     C    F C  G      E7 Am Dm7 C   G13      C
     So far away from home, so far away from home
     C                  F    C     G7   C      G    E7
     And I don't know a soul who's not been battered
                    Am            E7           Am
     I don't have a friend that's feels at ease
     C              F     C       G7 C      G     C B7  Am   E7          Am
     I don't know a dream that's not been shattered or driven to it's knees
     C9         F   G         F   C            F     C  G  F  Am   A7
     Aw, but it's alright, it's alright for we lived so well so long
     D7    G7                  C    G7       D         G
     Still when I think of the road we're travelin' on
     C   F C      G          E7 Am      Dm7          C  G13          C
     I wonder what's gone wrong, I can't help but wonder what's gone wrong
                 C
                 And I dreamed I was dying...
                                   G      G7        Am    Dm7
		 I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
                                  G7       F C                G
		 And looking back down on me smiled reassuringly
                 G7                  C
		 And I dreamed I was flying....
                             G       G7           Am        Dm7
		 And high up above my eyes could clearly see
                               G7        C               G
		 The Statue of Liberty - sailing away to sea
                G7                   C
		 And I dreamed I was flying....
     C                  F     C   G    C         G
     For we come on the ship they call Mayflower
     E7              Am        E7           Am
     We come on the ship that sailed the moon
        C           F C  G    C  G         C  B7  Am       E7         Am
     We come in the ages most uncertain hours and sing an American Tune
     C9              F   G         F   C          F  C  G E7 Am       A7
     Aw, but it's alright, it's alright you can't be forever blessed
     D7       G                  C  G7 D       G
     Still tomorrow's gonna be another working day
     C         F    C  G            E7 Am      Dm7  C      G13     G7   C
     And I'm trying to get some rest, that's all I'm trying to get some rest
