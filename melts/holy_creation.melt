Here it is another beautiful song by Kris...
its a shame there isn't very many tabs on here
he is one of the greatest songwriters of all time
 
anyway..its easy enough just pick the chords and 
strike some bass notes you should be able to get something
close to the recording

Intro
A x2
        A
So many questions
        D
So many answers
        A
So many reasons
             E
Most of them wrong

           A
Facing the future
                     D
With the faith of my father
        A
I let a stranger
E       A
Into my home

            
And right there before me
         D
I saw it happen
           A
There's no denying
              E
Nothing's the same

               A
The truth is a highway
           D
Leading to freedom
       A         E
All is forgiven
           A
Love is to blame



Chorus
                  D
And I've seen him hold her
                     A
With his head on her shoulder
                 E
Singing her love songs
            A
Soft as her smile
       D
Tender affection
          A
Under the rainbow
     E
Holy Creation
           A
Mother and child

           A
I know the story
           D
I read the papers
          A
I see the anger
          E
I feel it too

                   A
But when I see the wonder
                    D
In the smiles of my children
                 A        E
It reminds me of dreams
             A
Worth coming true

Repeat Chorus
