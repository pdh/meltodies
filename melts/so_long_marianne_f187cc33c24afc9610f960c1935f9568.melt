   come over to the window my little darling
    D                           A
   id like to try to read your palm

   before i let you take me home
    A                   F#m
   now so long marianne its time that we began
    E        Esus4      E     E7        E     Esus4       E
   to laugh         and cry        and cry           and laugh
   E7       A            Asus4        A          Asus4         A
