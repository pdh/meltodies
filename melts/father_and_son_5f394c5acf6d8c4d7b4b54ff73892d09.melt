It's not time to make a change, just relax and take it easy

You're still young that's your fault
           Am               D
there's so much you have to know

For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?  when I do he turns away again
     G               Em             Am    C  D
it's always been the same, same old story
         G              Bm         C          Am7
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
              G         Em     D       G
now there's a way and I know I have to go away
      D      C       G    G-C  riff  G-C riff
and I know I have to go



         G              D             C                 Am7
It's not time to make a change, just sit down and take it slowly
             G                 Em                         Am
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have

to go through
       G            D            C                Am7

        G          Bm             C                  Am7
All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
     G               Em             Am    C  D
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
         G              Bm         C          Am7
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know, not me
              G         Em     D       G
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away
      D      C       G
I know I have to go
