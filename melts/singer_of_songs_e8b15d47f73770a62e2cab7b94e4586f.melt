Chorus 1: 
A         D           A         D 
I'm not a savior, and I'm not a saint 
    A            D         A         D 
The man with the answers I certainly ain't 
A          D               A               D 
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong 
A          D         A 
I'm just a singer of songs 
 
 
          A              D            A  
But I can take you for a walk along a little country stream 
      A                    D                A  
I can make you see through lovers' eyes and understand their dreams 
      A               D                A  
I can help you hear a baby's laugh and feel the joy it brings 
       A              D       A   
Yes, I do it with the songs I sing 
 
 
Chorus 2:  
I'm not a prophet, and I'm not a priest 
I'm not a wise man who's come from the East 
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong 
I'm just a singer of songs 
 
 
But I can take you to a city where a man was crucified 
I can tell you how He lived, and I can tell you why He died 
I can help proclaim the glory of this mighty king of kings 
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing 
 
 
Chorus 3: 
I'm not a great man. I don't claim to be 
But when I meet my Maker and He questions me 
I won't hang my head. I'll stand proud and strong 
and say, "I was a singer. Lord, I was a singer 
Yes, I was a singer of songs
