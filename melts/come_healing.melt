   F               F
o gather up the brokenness
     Bb            F
and bring it to me now
     C                   C       
the fragrance of those promises
     Bb            C              
you never dared to vow


    Dm                 Bb          
the splinters that you carry
     F              C            
the cross you left behind
      Bb            F             
come healing of the body
     C              F            
come healing of the mind


    Bb              F             
and let the heavens hear it
     C           C               
the penitential hymn
     Bb             F             
come healing of the spirit
      C             F            
come healing of the limb


  F                 F            
behold the gates of mercy
    Bb         F                  
in arbitrary space
     C            C              
and none of us deserving
     Bb             C             
the cruelty or the grace


    Dm          Bb                 
o solitude of longing
      F             C            
where love has been confined
      Bb            F             
come healing of the body
      C             F            
come healing of the mind


  Bb                F             
o see the darkness yielding
     C              C            
that tore the light apart
     Bb              F            
come healing of the reason
      C              F           
come healing of the heart


   F             F               
o troubled dust concealing
    Bb       F                    
an undivided love
    C                 C          
the heart beneath is teaching
       Bb            C            
to the broken heart above


   Dm             Bb               
o let the heavens falter
    F              C             
and let the earth proclaim:
      Bb             F            
come healing of the altar
      C              F           
come healing of the name


   F             F               
o longing of the branches
   Bb              F              
to lift the little bud
   C               C             
o longing of the arteries
    Bb          C                 
to purify the blood


    Dm               Bb            
and let the heavens hear it
      F          C               
the penitential hymn
     Bb              F            
come healing of the spirit
     C              F            
come healing of the limb


   Bb              F              
o let the heavens hear it
     C          C                
the penitential hymn
     Bb              F            
come healing of the spirit
     C              F            
come healing of the limb
