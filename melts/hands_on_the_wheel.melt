Willie Nelson - Hands on the Wheel
Intro A E A E

          A                                                     D
At a time when the world seems to be spinnin'
A                               E
Hopelessly out of control
               A                                                       D
There's deceivers and believers and old in-betweeners
         A                   E                A
That seem to have no place to go


E                                                D                  A
Well it's the same old song, it's right and it's wrong
        F#m            F                         E
And livin' is just something that I do
                A                                                   D
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
       A           E             A
And I found myself in you

   E                                     D            A
I looked to the stars, tried all of the bars
        F#m           F                E
And I've nearly gone up in smoke 
               A                                                            D
Now my hand's on the wheel of somethin' that's real
       A              E             A
And I feel like I'm goin' home

                  A                                             D
And in the shade of an oak, down by the river
A                               E
Sat an old man and a boy
           A                                                    D
Settin' sails, spinnin tales, and fishin' for whales
           A             E                  A
With a lady that they both enjoy

                    E                                     D               A
Well it's the same damn tune, it's the man in the moon
            F#m         F               E
It's the way that I feel about you
                A                                                   D
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
       A           E             A
And I found myself in you

   E                                     D            A
I looked to the stars, tried all of the bars
        F#m           F                E
And I've nearly gone up in smoke 
               A                                                            D
Now my hand's on the wheel of somethin' that's real
       A              E             A
And I feel like I'm goin' home
