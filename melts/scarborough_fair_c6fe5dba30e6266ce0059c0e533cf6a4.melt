Verse 1

Dm      F        Am          Dm    
Are you going to Scarborough Fair
         F     G            Dm
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Dm       Am    Dm               C                               
Remember me to one who lives there
Dm       C     Am           Dm 
She once was a true love of mine



Verse 2

Dm            F        Am      Dm 
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green) 


         F     G            Dm
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Tracing of sparrow on snowcrested brown)


Dm         Am        Dm     C 
Without no seams nor needle work
(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)


Dm         C     Am           Dm 
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)



Verse 3

Dm          F          Am      Dm 
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves)


         F     G            Dm
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)


Dm          Am         Dm           C 
Between the salt water and the sea strands
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)


Dm         C     Am           Dm 
Then she'll be a true love of mine



Verse 4

Dm          F              Am          Dm 
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
(War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions)


         F     G            Dm
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)


     Dm       Am       Dm        C
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)


Dm         C     Am           Dm 
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Dm       Am     Dm           C 
Remember me to one who lives there
Dm       C     Am           Dm
She once was a true love of mine
