CENTERFIELD                                                           by John Fogerty


Intro:   G  C  D  G  (3x)  C  Bm Am D7

     G
Well beat the drum and hold the phone
    C               G
The sun came out today
      G                  Em               D      D7
We're born again there's new grass on the field
   G
A-'roundin' third and headed for home
       C                   G
It's a brown-eyed handsome man
    C             D              G
Anyone can understand the way I feel.

chorus

  G                                      C       G
   Put me in Coach   I'm ready to play today
G                                        C      Bm
   Put me in Coach  I'm ready to play today
           Am          D7             G
   Look at me  I can be   Centerfield


G
Well I spent some time in the Mudville Nine
C                    G
Watchin' it from the bench
           G                        Em                 D    D7
You know I took some lumps when the Mighty Case struck out
G
So Say Hey Willie tell the Cobb
    C          G                C
And Joe DiMaggio Don't say it ain't so
D                G
You know the time is now.

chorus -----  intro

      G                                                     C                 G
Got a beat-up glove a homemade bat  And a brand new pair of shoes
G                                         Em               D     D7
You know I think it's time  To give this game a ride
G                                                         C             G
Just to hit the ball and touch 'em all   A moment in the sun
     C                D                 G
It's gone and you can tell that one goodbye.
