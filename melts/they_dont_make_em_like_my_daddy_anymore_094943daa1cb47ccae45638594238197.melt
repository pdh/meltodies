	G
	I wasn't much more than a baby, I thought he was a bear,



	D
The Way my Daddy carried me a	round.
They said I learned to walk
While holding on to just one finger,


	G
On the hand of a man that's standin' six foot, 	three.
Not old enough to understand the meaning of depression:.


	D
Just somethin' people talk about a 	lot.
My Daddy wasn't one to try to make no big impression,
	G
Just one heck of a man that worked for what he'd 	got.
(Chorus)
	C
They don't make 'em like my 	Daddy any more.
	G	D
Guess they've 	thrown away the pattern through the 	years.
And in the great big land of freedom,
I know that we really need 'em:
	G
They don't make 'em like my Daddy any 	more.
From the Johnson County court house
To the hills of West Virginia,
	D
My Daddy worked down in them dark cold 	mines.
Education didn't count so much as what you had for mem'u
	G
Like the will to live an' a dream of better 	times.
Daddy never took a hand out; we ate pinto beans and bacon,
	D
But he worked to keep the wolf back from the d	oor.
And it only proves one thing to me,
When folks start bellyaching:
	G
They don't make 'em like my Daddy any 	more.
Repeat Chorus
