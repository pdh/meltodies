Song:The  Picture Show


G
A young man from a small town
         C                G
With a very large imagination
      C                          G
Lay alone in his room with his radio on
                       D
Looking for another station
            G
When the static from the mouthpiece
     C                  G
Gave way to the sound below
      C                G
James Dean went out to Hollywood
               D                 G
And put his picture in a Picture Show.
      C                G
James Dean went out to Hollywood
               D                 G
And put his picture in a Picture Show.


Chorus:

         G
And It's Oh Daddy get off of your knees
  C                     G
Mamma why'd you have to go
         C          G
Your darling Jim is out on a limb
            D                 G
I put my picture in a Picture Show
                   D                 G
Whoa Ho! Put my picture in a Picture Show

   G
Hamburgers Cheeseburgers
  C                G
Wilbur and Orville Wright
C                         G
John Garfield in the afternoon
                    D
Montgomery Clift at night
         G
When the static hit the mouthpiece
     C                  G
Gave way to the sound below
      C                G
James Dean went out to Hollywood
               D                 G
And put his picture in a Picture Show.


Chorus:

         G
And It's Oh Daddy get off of your knees
  C                     G
Mamma why'd you have to go
         C          G
Your darling Jim is out on a limb
            D                 G
I put my picture in a Picture Show
                   D                 G
Whoa Ho! Put my picture in a Picture Show

  G                        C              G
A Mocca man in a wigwam sitting on a Reservation.
           C                 G
With a big black hole in the belly of his soul
                    D
Waiting on an explanation
          G
While the white man sits on his fat can
             C              G
And takes pictures of the Navajo
      C                    G
Every time he clicks his Kodak pics
   D                       G
He steals a little bit of soul.
      C                    G
Every time he clicks his Kodak pics
   D                      G
He steals a little bit of soul.


Chorus:

         G
And It's Oh Daddy get off of your knees
  C                     G
Mamma why'd you have to go
         C          G
Your darling Jim is out on a limb
            D                 G
I put my picture in a Picture Show
                   D                 G
Whoa Ho! Put my picture in a Picture Show


Outro:
