Sounds Like Justice - Hank Williams, Jr
 
Album: 127 Rose Avenue

Key: E Major

E
He lived right across the street

A
It was on the news for the world to see

B7
They caught him with his hands on a neighbor's child

E
Now he swore he'd never done it before and he

E
cried before the judge in court so they

E
sent him away for just a little while

E
Mornin' found him in his cell

A
Somebody sent him straight to hell

B7
Beggin' for mercy down on his knees

E
Sounds like justice to me

CHORUS

E
Go on, do your dirty work

A
In your tailored suit and your clean white shirt

B7
You don't care who you hurt

E
Dealer sellin, dealin' lies
E
and hide inside a little glass pipe

A
So you don't care who dies

B7
This can't go on, I gotta believe

E
Hey that's Gabriel's horn blowin' on the breeze

E
Sounds like justice to me

VERSE 2

E
Mom and Pop had a corner store, It had

A
been there thirty years or more

E
And they'd been robbed about a hundred times

E
Punk walked in like he owned the place

A
Said give up the money as he slapped his face

E
He didn't know Pops had a .45

B7
They found him face down on the floor

B7
Dude never made it to the door

B7
Pop said I learned in the Army how to point and squeeze

And it sounds like justice to me




CHORUS 2

E
Go on, do your dirty work

A
In your tailored suit and your clean white shirt

E
You don't care who you hurt

E
Dealer sellin, dealin' lies

A
and hide inside a little glass pipe

E
So you don't care who dies

B7
It's gonna catch up to ya buddy, I gotta believe

B7
Hey that's Gabriel's horn blowin' on the breeze

E
Sounds like justice to me

INSTRUMENTAL BREAK

B7
Listen up

That's Gabriel's horn blowin' on the breeze

E
Sounds like justice to me

Sounds like justice to me

SPOKEN
(Vamp on E)

Keep messin' around

You're gonna meet the wrong dude in town

You reap what you sew
