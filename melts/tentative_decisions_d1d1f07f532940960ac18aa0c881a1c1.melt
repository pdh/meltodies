Tabbed by: Tyler Gjersee



Am
Now that I can release my tensions
Let me make clear my best intentions
Girls ask and I, define decision
Boys ask and I, describe their function

F        C   F       C
Oh, the boys want to talk
F       G        F          G
Who like to talk about those problems
F        C      F          C
And the girls, say they're concerned
F           G           F         G
And they are concerned with these decisions
F            C
And it's all hard logic
F        G        F         G
To follow and the girls get lost
F       C      F           C
And the boys, say they're concerned
F        G           F           C
But they are concerned with decisiveness 

(The Em is a just a quick hit to the G)
Em      G
I wanna talk
Am            D  
I wanna talk as much as I want
Em     G
I'm gonna give
Am                 D
I'm gonna give the problem to you

Em      G
I wanna talk
Am            D  
I wanna talk as much as I want
Em     G
I'm gonna give
Am                 D
I'm gonna give the problem to you


G
Decide, decide, make up your mind
Decide, decide, I told you what to say
Confuse, confuse, describe what I found
Confuse, confuse, I told you what to say


Oh, the girls still want to talk
Like to talk about those problems
And the boys, say they're concerned
But they are concerned with these decisions

And it's all hard logic
I know and the girls get lost
And the boys, say they're concerned
But they are concerned with these decisions

I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you

I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you

Decide, decide, make up your mind
Decide, decide, I told you what to say
Confuse, confuse, describe what I found
Confuse, confuse, I told you what to say

Pound on G until the very end.
