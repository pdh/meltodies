Bob Dylan - Cant Wait
Time Out of Mind
______________________

(the intro is pretty screwed up, so i cant really tab that part.)

when the Abm chord is played, theres a high note that plays...
e|----7---6---4---------|------7---6---4--------------------------
B|----4---4---4-(Abm)---|------6---6---6-(Dbm)--------------------
G|----4---4---4---------|------6---6---6--------------------------
D|----6---6---6---------|------6---6---6--------------------------
A|----6---6---6---------|------4---4---4--------------------------
E|----4---4---4---------|------x---x---x--------------------------
ok so thats the lead guitar kinda part.

the chords are pretty much in two different progressions.
(Ill call them A and B)

the A part goes like this, its REALLY simple theres two chords
and its pretty damn simple:

           Abm        Dbm                   Abm
I can't wait,        wait for you to change your mind
      Abm    Dbm                           Abm
It's late;        I'm trying to walk the line
            Abm                            Abm
Well it's way past midnight and there are people all around
Dbm                                  Dbm
    Some on their way up, some on their way down
Abm                                      Dbm
    The air burns and I'm trying to think straight

and there is the B part, which is only one line:
im really not too sure about the chords, but 
this is the best i could come up with...

E                          B        F#m 
  And I don't know how much longer I can wait


A I'm your man; I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
  You understand that my heart cant go on beating without you
  Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm reeling from the blow
  I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
  I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate
B But I don't know how much longer I can wait

A Skies are grey, I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
  Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore; I just go
  If I ever saw you coming I don't know what I would do
  I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true
  That's how it is when things disintegrate
B And I don't know how much longer I can wait

A I'm doomed to love you, Ive been rolling through stormy weather
  I'm thinking of you and all the 
? places we could roam together

A It's mighty funny; the end of time has just begun
  Oh, honey, after all these years youre still the one
  While I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
  I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
  I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
B But I don't know how much longer I can wait.

-Liam J. Rider
