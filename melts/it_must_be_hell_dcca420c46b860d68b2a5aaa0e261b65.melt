VERSE:
       G         C                 G
       We got trouble, that's for sure
               C           G
       We got millions unemployed
                         C               *NOTE: ENTIRE SONG IS
       Some kids can't write                       ONLY THE  
                        G                     C &amp; G BARRE CHORDS
       Some kids can't read 
                      C
       Some kids are hungry
 
                 G    INTRO RIFF - 2x's
       Some overeat


VERSE: 
       Our TV leader boldly speaks
       The words of Christ he tries to preach
       We need more power to hold the line
       The strength of darkness still abides


CHORUS:
                C   C C C C C  G
       Must be hell
        C        
       Living in the world
                                 G    INTRO RIFF
       Living in the world like you

                C   C C C C C  G
       Must be hell
        C
       Living in the world
                                    G   INTRO RIFF --2x's
       Suffering in the world like you



VERSE:
       Keep in a straight line, stay in tune
       No need to worry, only fools
       End up in prison of conscience cells
       Or in asylums they help to build


CHORUS:
       Must be hell living in the world
       Suffering in the world like you -- OPENING RIFF

       Must be hell living in the world
       Suffering in the world like you --OPENING RIFF

       Must be hell
       Suffering in the world like you -- OPENING RIFF -- 3x's


INSTRUMENTAL: SOLO OVER OPENING RIFF -- 5x's


VERSE:
       We're free to worship, we're free to speak
       We're free to kill, that's guaranteed
       We've got our problems, that's for sure
       Clean up the backyard, don't lock the door


CHORUS:
       Must be hell living in the world
       Suffering in the world like you
       Must be hell living in the world
       Suffering in the world like you


OUTRO:        OPENING RIFF OVER AND OVER UTIL END
