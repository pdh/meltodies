E                  B7                        E                      A
Rambin' round your city, ramblin' round your town.  I always meet a friend 
          B7             E              B7            E
I know as I go ramblin' round, boys, as I go ramblin' round.

E                  B7                            E
Some folks say i'm worthless, some folks say I'm poor.  But I'm the richest 
A             B7               E             B7               E
man I know, I could not handle more, boys, I cound not handle more.
