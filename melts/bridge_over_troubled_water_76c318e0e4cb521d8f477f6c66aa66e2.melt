Verse 1:

When you're weary, feeling small,

When tears are in your eyes, 
       D          G
I will dry them all
   A   Bm   A                         D       D7
I'm on your side. Ohhhh When times get rough

And friends just can't be found,

Chorus 1:
D7  D9  G      A7   D      Bm     G
Like a bridge over troubled water
       A7      D
I will lay me down.

Like a bridge over troubled water

I will lay me down.
