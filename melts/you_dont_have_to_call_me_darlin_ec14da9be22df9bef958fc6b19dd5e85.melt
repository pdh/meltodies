 this song is pretty easy to play! have fun w/ it

C                       G
It was all that I could do
               C
to keep from cryin'
      F                            C
sometimes it seems so useless to remain
F                                 C
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
                 G            C
You never even call me by my name.
 C              G                   C
You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
 C                     G                C
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride.
 F                                C        Am
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard, anymore.
 D                               G
Even though your on my fightin' side.

CHORUS
          F                               C
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
                      G
And I never minded standin' in the rain.
 F                               C
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
                G             C
You never even call me by my name.



I've heard my name a few times in your phone book
I've seen it on signs where I've laid
But the only time I know, I'll hear David Allan Coe
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day.


CHORUS:


(enter now the Steve Goodman story.  The first half is played with a background
 of C and G.  Just before Steve writes back with the perfect Country and
Western song, it is just a straight background C chord.


Well, I was drunk the day my Mom got outta prison.
And I went to pick her up in the rain.
But, before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got runned over by a damned old train.

CHORUS:

So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain. No,
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
 C              G           F                   C
You never even call me, I wonder why you don't call me
     F              C             G     C F C
Why don't you ever call me by my name.
