        Bonnie St. Johnstone 
Written by Trad. Arr. R. Thompson   (Chords by Justus)
1000 years of popular music
        

The Chords are right in my opinion. But it wont't sound like the album version, if 
you just play them. 
You have to alter the chords for example play this instead of an A chord:
--------------|
--------------|
----2---2---2-|
---2---1---2--|
--0---0---0---|
--------------|
And use the powerchords for the D major.
If you get it right this is an awesome, sad and very hard song to sing.
cheers, J.


Dbm              E             A           B
Leaned her back against an oak, Edinburgh, Edinburgh
Dbm             E                A
Leaned her back against an oak, Stirling for ay
D                       Dbm     A                         B
Leaned her back against an oak, first it bent and then it broke
Dbm       E                  A
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay

Leaned her back against a thorn, Edinburgh, Edinburgh
Leaned her back against a thorn, Stirling for ay
Leaned her back against a thorn, two bonniest babes that e’er were born
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay

She’s pulled out her snow-white breast, Edingburgh, Edinburg
She’s pulled out her snow-white breast, Stirling for ay
She’s pulled out her snow-white breast, and bid them suck, though it was the last
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay

She pulled out out her little knife, Edinburgh, Edinburgh
She pulled out out her little knife,  Stirling for ay
She pulled out out her little knife, And pirced away their tender life 
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay

Shes Washed the knife all in a brook, Edinburgh, Edinburgh
Shes Washed the knife all in a brook,  Stirling for ay
Washed the knife all in a brook, The more she washed, the redder it looked 
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay

She looks over her father’s wall, Edinburgh, Edinburgh
She looks over her father’s wall,  Stirling for ay
She looks over her father’s wall, And sees two babes a-playing at ball
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay

O babes, if you were mine, Edinburgh, Edinburgh
O babes, if you were mine
O babes, if you were mine, I’d dress you in the silk so fine 
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay

Mother, when we were thine, Edinburgh, Edinburgh
Mother, when we were thine,  Stirling for ay
Mother, when we were thine, around our necks you pulled the twine
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay

Now were in the heaven so high, Edinburgh, Edinburgh
Now were in the heaven so high,  Stirling for ay
Now were in the heaven so high, and in hell fires you shall die
And Bonny St. Johnstone lies fair upon Tay
