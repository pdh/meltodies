Aurora Borealis, the icy sky at night
Em7                        D
Paddles cut the water in a long and hurried flight
         A         C       Gadd6/B   D
From the white man  to the fields of green
         A       C      Gadd6/B D
And the homeland  we've never  seen


HARMONICA SOLO 1:   D   Dmaj7   Em7   D

     D
They killed us in our teepee, and they cut our women down
     Em7                         D
They might have left some babies cryin' on the ground
        A          C         Gadd6/B  D
But the firesticks   and the wagons   come
        A           C        Gadd6/B D
And the night falls   on the settin' sun


HARMONICA SOLO 2:   D   Dmaj7   Em7   D    A   C Gadd6/B D

     D
They massacred the buffalo, kitty corner from the bank
    Em7                              D
The taxis run across my feet, and my eyes have turned to blanks
      A          C        Gadd6/B    D
In my little box  at the top of the stairs
        A          C       Gadd6/B D
With my indian rug   and a pipe to share


HARMONICA SOLO 3:
D   Dadd6 D7/9 Dadd6 D7/9  Em7   D
A   C Gadd6/B   D    A   C Gadd6/B  D

  D
I wish I was a trapper, I would give a thousand pelts
   Em7                       D
To sleep with Pocahontas and find out how she felt
       A       C         Gadd6/B   D
In the mornin'    on the fields of green
       A        C        Gadd6/B D
In the homeland    we've never   seen


HARMONICA SOLO 4:   D   Dmaj7   Em7   D


    D
And maybe Marlon Brando will be there by the fire
      Em7                               D
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood and the good things there for hire
        A         C         Gadd6/B   D
And the Astradome   and the first  teepee
       A      C     Gadd6/B    D
Marlon Brando,  Pocahontas and me
       A      C     Gadd6/B    D
Marlon Brando,  Pocahontas and me

    A     C   Gadd6/B D
Pocahontas
