Ab        Fm               Db           Bbm
Everybody gather round and listen to my song,
                       Ab
I've only got one.

           Ab                       Cm
We who are young, should now take a stand,
                   Fm                   Eb11
Don't run from the burdens of women and men,
            Gb         Db
Continue to give, continue to live
             Bbm            Eb
For what you know is right.

             Ab                 Cm
Most of your life can be out of sight,
                  Fm                       Eb11
Withdraw from the darkness and look to the light;
                 Gb            Db
Where everyone's free, 'least that's the way it's
            Bbm            Eb
Supposed to be.

            Db      Ab          Abmaj7
And we just keep on keeping on
        Db              Ab
We just keep on keeping on

     Gb                 Db
Many think that we have blown it
         Bbm7
But they too will soon admit
             Bbm7    Cm7    Eb13
That there's still a lot of love among us
            Bbm7    Cm7    Eb13
And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust.
        Db              Ab
When we keep on keeping on.

             Ab                  Cm
Before we dismiss, one thing I insist
                   Fm                   Eb11
When you have your young, remember this song,
                Gb
And our world surrounding, its leaps and and bounds,
Db                     Bbm             Eb
Ups and downs, is reality

                 Ab                        Cm
Teach them to be strong, and when they are grown,
         Fm                            Eb11
They can proudly imply that we were an alright guy,
    Gb                                  Db
For all the wrong now is right and this nations people united
Bbm            Eb
As one.

            Db      Ab           Abmaj7
And we just keep on keeping on
        Db              Ab
We just keep on keeping on

     Gb                 Db
Many think that we have blown it
         Bbm7
But they too will soon admit
             Bbm7    Cm7    Eb13
That there's still a lot of love among us
            Bbm7    Cm7    Eb13
And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust
        Db              Ab
When we keep on keeping on.

Ab
We're gonna move on up y'all.

Keep on keeping on.
