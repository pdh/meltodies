      A         D                    E          A     D   A
Oh Sis-ters of Mer-cy they are not de-par-ted or gone

      C#m             G#m           C#m          G#m         E   Esus4 E
They were wait-ing for me when I thought that I just cant go on

      D                     A          G          F#m              E Esus4 E
And they brought me their com-fort and later they brought me their song

   A           D                        E           A     D
Oh I hope you into them you who've been trav-ling so long

G/D D/A A7 D    G/D D/A A7 D        A       E

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes you who must leave everything
That you cannot control
It begins with your family,
but soon it comes round to your soul
Well I've been where you're hanging
I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy
Your loneliness says that your've sinned

They lay down beside me
I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes
And I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind yoou with love
That is graceful and green as a stem

When I left they were sleeping
I hope you run into them soon
Dont turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon
And you wont make me jealous
If I hear that they sweetened your night

D   E

          A            D
We werent lov-ers like that
       A                 E          A
And besides it would still be all right

We werent lovers like that
And besides it would still be all right


C#m       G#m       Esus4     F#m       G/D       D/A       A7
