G               A7
SIOUX CITY SUE, SIOUX CITY SUE,
     D7
YOUR HAIR IS RED, YOUR EYES ARE BLUE
    G       C         G       D7
I'D SWAP MY HORSE AND DOG FOR YOU.
G               A7
SIOUX CITY SUE, SIOUX CITY SUE
      Am              D7
THERE AIN'T NO GAL AS TRUE
                       G
AS MY SWEET SIOUX CITY SUE.


  G                                A7
I DROVE A HERD OF CATTLE DOWN FROM OLD NEBRASKA WAY
       D7                                   G
THAT'S HOW I COME TO BE IN THE STATE OF I-O-WAY
                             A7
I MET A GIRL IN I-O-WAY; HER EYES WERE BIG AND BLUE
  D7                                               G
I ASKED HER WHAT HER NAME WAS. SHE SAID SIOUX CITY SUE


G               A7
SIOUX CITY SUE, SIOUX CITY SUE,
     D7
YOUR HAIR IS RED, YOUR EYES ARE BLUE
    G       C         G       D7
I'D SWAP MY HORSE AND DOG FOR YOU.
G               A7
SIOUX CITY SUE, SIOUX CITY SUE
      Am              D7
THERE AIN'T NO GAL AS TRUE
                       G
AS MY SWEET SIOUX CITY SUE.
