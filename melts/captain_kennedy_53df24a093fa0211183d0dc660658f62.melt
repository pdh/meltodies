CAPTAIN KENNEDY

Capo 3rd fret!

Dm 
Dm                   C         Dm      
I am a young mariner headed to war
                                 F           Dm
I'm thinkin' 'bout my family and what it was for
                         F                       Dm
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
                                      C        Dm
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good

My father was a sailor named Captain Kennedy
He lost his wooden schooner to the Germans on the sea
Exploded on the water for everyone for everyone to see
And humiliate that American Captain Kennedy

Dm                     C                  Dm
I saw him in Nassau in ninteen seventy one
                                F              Dm
His strength was failin' but he still ran a run
                   F                   Dm
He worked 'til his fingers wore to the bone
                                C           Dm
To buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own

He was known in the islands as hundred foot iron
That steel hull freighter was passin' its time
And time flew by faster with life on the sea
And the days grew shorter for Captain Kennedy

I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinkin' 'bout my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good
