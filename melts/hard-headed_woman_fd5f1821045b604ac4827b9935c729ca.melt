 People who can glide you, on a floor.
F     C       F           C       G
 They move so smooth, but have no answers,

 When you ask: "why'd you come here for?"... why?

But their friendliness de-pends, on how you do.
Em               A          Em
 They know, many sure fired ways,
        A               C         B          E  E7
To find out, the on who pays; and how you do.
