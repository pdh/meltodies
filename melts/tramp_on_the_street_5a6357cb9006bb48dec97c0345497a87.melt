The Tramp on the Street
by Hank Williams

C                            F
Only a tramp was Lazarus sad fate
           G7                     C
He who lay down at the rich man's gate
                                              F
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat
              C            G7          C
He was only a tramp found  dead on the street  
                                                  F
He was some mother's darlin' he was some mother's son
            G7                   C
Once he was fair and once he was young
                                      F
Some mother rocked him her darlin' to sleep
                     C           G7           C
But they left him to die like  a tramp on the street  
                            F
Jesus who died on Calvary's tree
                G7                    C
Shed His life's blood for you and for me
                                         F
They pierced His sides His hands and His feet
                     C           G7           C
And they left Him to die like a  tramp on the street  
                                              F
He was Mary's own darlin' he was God's chosen Son
            G7                   C
Once He was fair and once He was young
                                   F
Mary she rocked Him her darlin' to sleep
                     C          G7           C
But they left Him to die like a tramp on the street  
                                       F
If Jesus should come and knock on your door
               G7                         C
For a place to come in or bread from your store
                                     F
Would you welcome Him in or turn Him away 
                     C               G7              C
Then the God's would deny you on the Great Judgment Day
