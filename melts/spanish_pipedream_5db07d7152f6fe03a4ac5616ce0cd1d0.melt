          G                          C
She was a level headed dancer on the road to alcohol
    D                                       G
And I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal
         G                 
Well she pressed her chest against me
          C
About the time the juke box broke
          D
Yeah, she gave me a peck on the back of the neck
                            G
And these are the words she spoke



Chorus:
             G
Blow up your T.V. throw away your paper
          D                    G
Go to the country, build you a home
               G
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
            D             G
Try an find Jesus on your own 



        G                            C
Well, I sat there at the table and I acted real naive
      D                                           G
For I knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve
          G                                  C    
Well, she danced around the bar room and she did the hoochy-coo
         D                                                G
Yeah she sang her song all night long, tellin me what to do


(Repeat chorus)


      G                           C
Well, I was young and hungry and about to leave that place
     D                                               G
When just as I was leavin, well she looked me in the face
       G                                  C
I said You must know the answer, She said No but I'll give it a try
       D
And to this very day we've been livin our way 
                       G
And here is the reason why


               G
We blew up our T.V. threw away our paper
            D                   G
Went to the country, built us a home
             G
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
               D              G    C  G
They all found Jesus on their own
