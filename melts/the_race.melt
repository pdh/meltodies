INTRO:  Cadd9  G   Cadd9  G   Cadd9  G   D  G

Cadd9                        G
The race is harder than arithmatic
Cadd9                     G
Some will say it can't be won
Cadd9                         G
Son it gets harder when your shoes are slick
G/B                      D
But I had set my mind to run

Cadd9                     G
And it was harder that I bargained for
Cadd9                     G
Broken dreams at every turn
Cadd9                  G
I had heart enough to almost make it thru
G/B                 D
And a lesson yet to learn

Cadd9                         G
I slipped and fell before the finish line
Cadd9                          G
Just when it seemed I couldn't lose
Cadd9                   G
I can fall anytime you want me to
G/B          D              G
You are the s**t beneath my shoes
