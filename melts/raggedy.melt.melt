Tabbed by: Kent

Just a simple old I-V-I-IV folk song that should be heard more. From Pete's
"American Industrial Ballads" album.
(When it goes from D to G, may want to play with the descending bass line:
D - C# - B.)


Raggedy, raggedy are [D] we.
Just as raggedy as raggedy can [A] be.
We [D] don't get nothing for our [G] labor.
So [D] raggedy, [A] raggedy are [D] we.

(Hungry!)
Hungry, hungry are [D] we.
Just as hungry as hungry can [A] be.
We [D] don't get nothing for our [G] labor.
So [D] hungry, [A] hungry are [D] we.

(Homeless!)
Homeless, homeless are [D] we.
Just as homeless as homeless can [A] be.
We [D] don't get nothing for our [G] labor.
So [D] homeless, [A] homeless are [D] we.

(Landless!)
Landless, landless are [D] we.
Just as landless as landless can [A] be.
We [D] don't get nothing for our [G] labor.
So [D] landless, [A] landless are [D] we.

(Cow-less!)
Cow-less, cow-less are [D] we.
Just as cow-less as cow-less can [A] be.
We [D] don't get nothing for our [G] labor.
So [D] cow-less, [A] cow-less are [D] we.

So hog-less, hog-less are [D] we.
Just as hog-less as hog-less can [A] be.
We [D] don't get nothing for our [G] labor.
So [D] hog-less, [A] hog-less are [D] we.

(Union!)
Union, Union are [D] we.
Just as Union as Union can [A] be.
We [D] don't get nothing for our [G] labor.
So [D] Union, [A] Union are [D] we.
(X2)
