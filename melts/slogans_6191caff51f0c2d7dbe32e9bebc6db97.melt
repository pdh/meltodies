CHORUS
C               G                Am F
Can't take your slogans no more,
C               G                Am F
Can't take your slogans no more,
C               G                Am F
Can't take your slogans no more,
C               G                Am F
Can't take your slogans no more,


VERSE: 
C  G  Am  F

Wipe out the paintings of slogans
all over the streets (ooh, ooh, ooh),
confusing the people
while your asphalt burns our tired feet.
I see borders and barriers,
segregation, demonstration and riots (ooh, ooh, ooh),
a-sufferation of the refugees,
oh-oh, when, when will we be free?

CHORUS:
C  G  Am  F

Oh-oh-oh, we can't take your slogans no more,
can't take your slogans no more,
can't take your slogans no more,
no more sweet talk from-a pulpit,
no more sweet talk from the hypocrites

guitar solo:  
C  G  Am  F (2x)

C  G  Am  F
So we know we can't take your slogans no more,
can't take your slogans no more,
can't take your slogans no more,
no more sweet talk from-a pulpit,
no more sweet talk from the pulpit.


C  G  Am  F
No more sweet talk from-a pulpit,
no more sweet talk from the hypocrites (oh, no hypocrites!),
no more sweet talk from-a pulpit (wo-ah yeah),
no more sweet talk (no-no-no-no sweet talk) from the hypocrites (hey!),
no more sweet talk from-a pulpit,
no more sweet talk (no-no-no-no sweet talk) from the hypocrites (no-no-no-no hey!).
