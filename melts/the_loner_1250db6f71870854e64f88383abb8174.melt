THE LONER

Dm7  G/D  C/D  D  Csus2  D  G7  D  Csus2

D         G7                                              D 
He's the perfect stranger like a cross of himself and a fox.

D7sus4    G7                                            D  D7sus4  D
He's a feeling arranger and a changer of the way he talks.

D7sus4   G7                                                 D
He's the unforeseen danger and the keeper of the key to the locks. 

Csus2  D  Csus2

Gm7           Am7    Gm7           Am7
Know when you see him, nothing can free him.

Gm7       Am7       D
Step aside, open wide, it's the loner.

Dm7  G/D  C/D  D  Csus2  D  G7  D Csus2  

If you see him in the subway, he'll be down at the end of the car,
Watching you move until he knows, he knows who you are.
When you get off at the station alone, he'll know that you are.
Know when you see him, nothing can free him.
Step aside, open wide, it's the loner.

There was a woman he knew about a year or so ago.
She had something that he needed and he pleaded with her not to go.
On the day that she left, he died but it did not show.
Know when you see him, nothing can free him.
Gm7       Am7       D                   F6  D
Step aside, open wide, it's the loner.
