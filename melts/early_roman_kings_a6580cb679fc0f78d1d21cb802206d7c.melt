Verse 1:
G-G11-G 
Ah the early Roman kings, in their shark skin suits. 
G-G11-G                              C-C11-C
Bow ties and buttons, high-top boots. 
C-C11-C                                 G-G11-G 
Drivin' the spikes in, blazin' the rails. 
G-G11-G                                        C-C11-C
Nailed in their coffins, in top hats and tails. 
C-C11-C                                 G-G11-G 
Fly away over, fly away, flap your wings. 
G-G11-G 
Fly by night, like the early Roman kings.

Verse 2:
G-G11-G 
Ah the early Roman kings, were never really born.
G-G11-G                                         C-C11-C 
Comin' down the mountain, distributing the corn.
C-C11-C                                               G-G11-G 
Speedin' through the forest, ah racin' down the track.
G-G11-G                                    C-C11-C
Ya trying' to get away, they drag you back.
C-C11-C                                      G-G11-G 
Tomorrow is Friday, we'll see what it brings.
G-G11-G
Everybody's talkin' about the early Roman kings.

Verse 3
G-G11-G
The peddlers and the meddlers, they buy and they sell.
G-G11-G                                               C-C11-C  
They destroyed your city, they'll destroy you as well. 
C-C11-C                                                    G-G11-G
They're lecherous and treacherous, a-hell-bent for leather. 
G-G11-G                                       C-C11-C 
Each of 'em bigger, than all men put together. 
C-C11-C                                        G-G11-G
Sluggers and muggers, wearin' fancy gold rings.
G-G11-G   
All the women goin' crazy, for the early Roman kings.

Verse 4
G-G11-G
I could dress up you wounds, with a blood-clotted rag.
G-G11-G                                         C-C11-C
I ain't afraid to make love, to a bitch of a hag.
C-C11-C                                        G-G11-G
If you see me comin' and you're standin' there,
G-G11-G                           C-C11-C
Wave your handkerchief in the air.
C-C11-C                                     G-G11-G
I ain't dead yet, my bell still still rings.
G-G11-G
I keep my fingers crossed like the early Roman kings.

Verse 5:
C-C11-C 
I could strip you of life, strip you of bread.
G-G11-G                              C-C11-C
Ship you down, to the house of death.
C-C11-C                      G-G11-G
One day, you will ask for me.
G-G11-G                                       C-C11-C 
They'll be no-one else, that you'll wanna see. 
C-C11-C                               G-G11-G
Bring down fiddle, tune up my strings.
G-G11-G
I'm gonna brake it wide open, like the early Roman kings.

Verse 6:
C-C11-C 
I was up on Black Mountain, the day Detroit fell.
G-G11-G                                             C-C11-C
They killed them all off and they sent them to Hell.
C-C11-C                                 G-G11-G
Ding-dong-daddy, you're comin' up short.
G-G11-G                                      C-C11-C
They'll put you on trial, in a Sicilian Court.
C-C11-C                               G-G11-G
I have had my fun, I've had my flings.
G-G11-G
Goin' shake 'em on down, like the early Roman kings.
