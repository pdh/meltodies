        Don't Think Twice, It's Alright (Album Version)
                        By Bob Dylan


This song is played in clawhammer picking style
fast.  The picking patterns are up to you
I've seen some un capo'd versions, but this
is the correct album version. Enjoy


Capo 4



C                   G             Am            F
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
                       C  G 
Even you don't know by now 
C                       G               Am       D7
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
                  G
It'l never do somehow 
             C                  C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn 
F                          D7
Look out your window and I'll be gone 
C             G         Am      F
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on 
C             G                 C
Don't think twice, it's all right 

C                    G                Am        F
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light,babe
                        C  G
That light I never knowed
C                       G               Am          D7
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light,babe
                             G  
I'm on the dark side of the road
        C                                  C7
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
    F                         D7
To try and make me change my mind and stay
C         G             Am      F
We never did too much talkin' anyway
C             G             C
Don't think twice,it's all right

C                    G              Am        F
It ain't no use in callin' out my name,babe
                       C  G
Like you never did before
        C               G              Am        D7
And It ain't no use in callin' out my name,babe
                        G 
I can't hear you anymore
        C                               C7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' all the way down the road
   F                      D7
I once loved aw woman,a child I'm told
   C            G             Am       F
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
C             G             C
Don't think twice,it's all right


C  G                 Am

So Loooooong, honey babe
            F            C  G
Where I'm bound,I can't tell
       C       G          Am        D7
But goodbye's too good a word,babe
                               G
So I'll just say fare thee well
C                          C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
      F                        D7
You could have done better but I don't mind
C               G              Am       F       

You just kinda wasted myyyyy precious time
      C           G              C
But don't think twice,it's alllll right
