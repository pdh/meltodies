Chain Gang chords
Sam Cooke

G    Em
ooh! aah! 4x

I hear something saying
G    Em
ooh! aah! 4x

I hear something saying
G    Em
ooh! aah! 8x
                  
(Well, don't you know?)

G                       C                  G     Em  G     
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang
                        C                  D     G 
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang
                             
All day long they're singing 

G    Em
ooh! aah! 4x

(Well, don't you know?)

G                       C                  G     Em  G     
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang
                        C                  D     G 
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang

G                 Em 
All day long they work so hard, 
C                      D
'till the sun is going down
G              Em
Working on the highway and byways, 
    C                  D   
and wearing, wearing a frown
G                           Em
You hear them moaning their lives away,
C                 D 
then you hear somebody say

G                       C                  G     Em  G     
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang
                        C                  D     G 
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang

Can't you hear them saying?

G    Em
ooh! aah! 4x

(Well, don't you know?)
G                       C                  G     Em  G     
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang
                        C                  D     G 
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang

Can't you hear them saying?

G             Em                C             
Mm, I'm going home one of these days,
D                     G 
I'm going home see my woman,
       Em
whom I love so dear
     C                  G          D
But, meanwhile I got to work right here

(Well, don't you know?)

G                       C                  G     Em  G     
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang
                        C                  D     G 
That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang

All day long they're singing

G    Em          C              D    
hmm, my, my, my, my, my, my, my work is so hard
        G          Em     
Give me water, I'm thirsty
C      D    
My, my work is so hard

G    Em          C              D    
hmm, my, my, my, my, my, my, my work is so hard
        G          Em     
Give me water, I'm thirsty
C      D    
My, my work is so hard

G    Em          C              D    
hmm, my, my, my, my, my, my, my work is so hard
        G          Em     
Give me water, I'm thirsty
C      D    
My, my work is so hard
