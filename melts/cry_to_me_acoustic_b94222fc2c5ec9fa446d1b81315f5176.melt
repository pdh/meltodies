The reaction of your cheating game 

 

Lord knows how I get from the heartaches 
Lord that leadeth me yeah! 
And now I'm by the still water 

 
You've got to crawl to me yeah! 
Cry to me 
Cry to me 

Walk back through the heartaches 
Walk back through the pain 
Shed those lonely teardrops 
Reaction of your cheating game


Cry to me 
Cry to me
