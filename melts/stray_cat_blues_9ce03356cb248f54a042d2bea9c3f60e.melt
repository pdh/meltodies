Subject: Stray Cat Blues Lyrics

Someone had asked for the lyrics to "Stray Cat Blues" by the Rolling Stones.

This is as near as I can figure out:

I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs,
I know your loping stride, babe.
I'll be a beast if you just come up stairs, but
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime.

And I can see that you're just fifteen years old
But I don't want your ID
Don't look so scared, I'm not not hair-brained bear

And it's no hangin matter
It's no capital crime

CHORUS
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat, oh yeah,
Won't you scratch my back, oh yeah,
You're a strange stray cat, I bet,
I bet your mama don't know that you bite like that
I bet your mama don't  know that you spit like that

You've got a friend, you say she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild then she can join in, too--
It's no hangin' matter,
It ain't no capital crime

CHORUS

You're alone so far from home,
But you don't really miss your mother
I've been so many times all all alone

But it ain't no hangin' matter
It ain't no capital crime

CHORUS
