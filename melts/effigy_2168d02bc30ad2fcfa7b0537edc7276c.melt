Subject: CRD: "Effigy"--Creedence Clearwater Revival (Corrected)


"Effigy" by Creedence Clearwater Revival
from the album Willy and the Poorboys--1969
transribed hastily (too hastily, since I got it wrong and had to fix it)
by Patrick Glass (patrick@spy.net)

Just the chords, because I can't quite make out all of the solo, but once
you know what the chords are, it's not too hard.

This is the whole chord progression:

C       D   Dsus4 D     G       C       G       E       E7      E       E7


Put it with the words and it sounds like this

C        D   Dsus4 D
Last night,
G              C       G    E          E7 E    E7
I saw the fire burning on the palace door
C        D   Dsus4 D
O'er the land,
G               C            G   E       E7 E   E7
Humble subjects watched with mixed  emotion
C              D Dsus4 D
Who is burning
G      C   Am7 E        E7 E  E7
Who is burning the effigy
(repeat that line again)

And here are all the words for the song:

Last night, I saw the fire burning on the palace lawn
O'er the land, humble subjects watched with mixed emotion
Who is burning, who is burning, the effigy??
Who is burning, who is burning, effigy??

Last night, I saw the fire spreading to the palace door
Silent majority wasn't keeping quiet anymore
Who is burning, who is burning, the effigy??
Who is burning, who is burning, effigy??

Last night, I saw the fire spreading to the countryside
In the morning, few were left to watch the ashes die
Who is burning, who is burning, the effigy??
Who is burning, who is burning, effigy??
Why? Why? Why? Effigy!

By far, my favorite CCR song. It just kicks.

NOTE:You could play the second G as a G/B (x20003). It sounds pretty good
that way, and might actually be the way it goes. But I wouldn't know :)
