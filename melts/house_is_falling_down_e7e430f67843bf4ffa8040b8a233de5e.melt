Title: The House Is Falling Down
Album: Personal File

Johnny Cash sang alot in the key of Bb, and this song is no exception, so if you want to 
along with the CD put your capo on the 3rd fret.

G                                C              G
Man had need of shelter from the evil from the night
G                                    A7            D
The devil wind was blowin' and from heaven came a light
C                                   G             C
The Son of God, a carpenter, and he came with a plan
G                                     D             G
To build a house where heaven could be offered unto man


Chorus:

C                                 G
When he came here he layed down a mighty firm foundation
C                                          G
And the columns and the beams were churches scattered through the nation
C                                  G
Then rooms were added to it on that same old solid rock
A7                                               D
Then roofs were raised by willing hands from the bottom to the top
C                                          G
Then people came and filled the house with singin' prayer and praise
C                                   G
Some turned and rejected, his house fell on leaner days
G                            C
Son of God, o carpenter, will you come back around
G                                          D                 G
The blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down.

G                              C              G
Now the wind is raging and the devil's angry roar
G                               A7              D
Is screamin' at the windows and howlin' at the door
C                                       G                    C
And thought the faithful few inside are standing true and strong
G                                D                     G
The house has been neglected and it won't be standing long

(Chorus)


G                            C
Son of God, o carpenter, will you come back around
G                                          D                 G
Our Blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down.
