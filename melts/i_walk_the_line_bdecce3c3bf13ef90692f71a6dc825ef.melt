Capo 3

Verse 1:

D                    A                D
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
                    A            D 
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
            G                        D
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
               A                D 
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Verse 2:

G                   D           G  
I find it very, very easy to be true
G                   D                G
I find myself alone when each day is through
                A                   G         
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
               D                G
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Verse 3:

C              G                    C  
As sure as night is dark and day is light
               G                   C
I keep you on my mind both day and night
                F                         C
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
               G                C
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Verse 4: Same Chords as Verse 2

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Verse 5: Same Chords as Verse 1

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
