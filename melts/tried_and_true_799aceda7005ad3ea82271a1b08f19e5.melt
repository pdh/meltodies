C                          Em    Dsus2
At the dawn I woke, I was alone, rising
C                          Em              Dsus2
I called upon the force of time and space, calling
C                                 Em    Dsus2
And as she came to me I fell back down, realizing
C                          Em              Dsus2
That it's cool for you to love me now, I'm everything

F Em F Em
Everything-cause tried and true, I see the light in you
F Em D
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole-life?

C G Em Dm
You bent the edge, eclipsed and turned around, aligning
C G Em Dm
And through the dark sparked rays of violet light, blinding
C G Em Dm
I went about the job of sowing thoughts and feelings
C G Em Dm
Some were good, some bad, I felt the cries of healing

      F     G   Em   F               G   Em
Cause tried and true, I see the light in you
F                 Em                             Dsus2
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole-life?

C       Dm     C                    Dm
Rise my Dawn, you've been awake too long
C              Dm                     Dsus2
Let me rest in time while I blow your mind

***Solo***

***Solo 2***

C                          Em    Dsus2
At the dawn I woke, I was alone, rising

And as she came to me I fell back down, realizing
C                          Em              Dsus2
That it's cool for you to love me now, I'm everything

      F     G   Em   F               G   Em
Cause tried and true, I see the light in you
F                 Em                             Dsus2
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole-life?
