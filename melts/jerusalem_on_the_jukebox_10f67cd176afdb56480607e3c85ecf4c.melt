Jerusalem On The Jukebox 

G
Jerusalem on the jukebox they talk in tongues on Coronation Street
Heaven help the Pharisee whose halo has slipped down to his feet
  Am                   C                          G
A thousand satellite comedians have died for your sins
                 F        C               Am       G
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels beat you wings

At poolside picnics they chant for Ferraris and furs
Their muscle tone sharpens but their hold on reality blurs
You can have your cake and eat it and never have to puke up a thing
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels beat you wings

In the bathroom mirror they try the Joan of Arc look again
Two parts Ingrid Bergman to one part Shirley MacLaine
And the wounds of time kill you but the surgeon's knife only stings 
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels beat you wings

In video suburbia the blue light flickers and flames
Ecstasy and holy blackmail are the favourite games
And God has the sharpest suits and the cleanest chin
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels beat you wings

Ah the bride checks her hair and makeup, and here comes the groom
What one-eyed monster comes slouching into your front room
Rudolph Valentino or the curse of all two-legged things
Jerusalem on the jukebox, little angels beat you wings
Little angels beat your wings
