Verse sequence:
E                 Emaj7
I've seen love go by my door 
A
Never been this close before
E             Emaj7      B11
Never been so easy or so slow
     E               Emaj7
Been shooting in the dark too long
     A
When something's not right it's wrong
E                    B11               E
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Chorus sequence:
B11                              E
Flowers on the hillside bloomin' crazy
B11                                E
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme
F#        
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy
Aadd9
I could stay with forever 
    B7add11
And never realise the time
