INTRO:
 E        B7     E

 E
Moonlight shining on the back of my hand

Cat Fight rattlin' the garbage can
 A                                    E
Looks like somethin' chased you up a tree
 B7                                E
Same thing, same thing happened to me

  E
Wild wind blowing down the neck of my shirt

Old men sitting on a bench in the dirt
  A                                      E
Seems that another ship has gone out to sea
  B7                               E
Same thing, same thing happened to me

INSTRUMENTAL:
 E    A    E    B7   E

 E
Shoe shine someone's got to tell ya the news

A fine line separates a boy from the blues
 A                                 E
Looks like you could use some company
 B7                                E
Same thing, same thing happened to me

E
Runnin', runnin' just as fast as I can

Someone, someone take a hold of my hand
A                                     E
Looks like somethin' chased you up a tree
B7                                 E
Same thing, same thing happened to me
B7                                 E
Same thing, same thing happened to me

B7       E    E6
