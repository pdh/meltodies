You are dearer to me than myself

As you yourself can see

While I'm listening to the steel rails hum

Got both eyes tight shut

Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from

Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

Tossed by the winds and the seas
               C/C			 G/B
I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall
Am7/A			   D7/D
I'll sell 'em to their enemies

I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought

Gonna sleep off the rest of the day

Sometimes no one wants what we got

Sometimes you can't give it away

Sleep is like a temporary death

I can't save a dime

Into a life of continual crime

They waste your nights and days

But you I'll remember always

You've wounded me with your words

Gonna have to straighten out your tongue

It's all true, everything you've heard

(repeat chorus)

In you, my friend, I find no blame

Wanna look in my eyes, please do

    	No one can ever claim
Am7/A		   	 D7/D
That I took up arms against you

All across the peaceful sacred fields

They will lay you low

They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
Am7/A		     D7/D
I say it so it must be so

	     G			       G/F#
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
G/E		      G/D
Gonna give you another chance
     C/C			 G/B
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
 Am7/A			 D7/D
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
	  G		           G/F#
I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
G/E			    G/D
I can live on rice and beans

Some people never worked a day in their life
Am7/A		     	   D7/D
Don't know what work even means

(repeat chorus)
