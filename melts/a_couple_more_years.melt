B F#
I've got a couple more years on you, babe, and that's all.
B
I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.
E
Ain't that I'm wiser, I've just spent more time with my back to the wall.
F# B
And I've picked up a couple more years on you, babe, and that's all.
I've been down more roads than you, babe, and that's all.
I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl.
You're heading somewhere, I've been that somewhere, found its nowhere at all.
And I've picked up a couple more years on you babe, and that's all.
["I wrote that for you, never finished it."
"You should"]
