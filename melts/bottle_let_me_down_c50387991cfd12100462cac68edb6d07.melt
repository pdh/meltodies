D
Each night I leave the barroom when it's over
                                A7
Not feeling any pain at closing time
A7
But tonight you memory found me much to sober
                                         D
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind

CHORUS:
  D
Tonight the bottle let down
                         A7
and let you memory come around
A7
The one true friend I thought I'd found
                       D
Tonight the bottle let down

I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wind don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way

CHORUS

Tonight the bottle let down
