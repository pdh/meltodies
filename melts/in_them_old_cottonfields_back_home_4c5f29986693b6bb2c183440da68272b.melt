                E
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BITTY BABY
                                                      
                 A                E
MY MAMA USED TO ROCK ME IN THE CRADLE
                                                      
                               B
IN THEM OLD COTTON FIELDS BACK HOME
       E
IT WAS DOWN IN LOUISIANA
                                                      
              A             E      
JUST ABOUT A MILE FROM TEXARKANA
                                                      
             B                  E               
IN THEM OLD COTTON FIELDS BACK HOME

CHORUS

E               A                
WELL WHEN THOSE COTTON BALLS GET ROTTEN
          E
YOU CAN'T PICK VERY MUCH COTTON
                                                      
                               B
IN THEM OLD COTTON FIELDS BACK HOME
       E    
IT WAS DOWN IN LOUISIANA
                                                      
             A          E
JUST ABOUT A MILE FROM TEXARKANA
                                                      
             B                 E
