Things Have Changed chords
Bob Dylan *

Gm  Gm 

  Gm
A worried man with a worried mind
Cm
No one in front of me and nothing behind
          Gm                                     D
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne
Gm
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes
    Cm
I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies
    Gm            D7                  Gm
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train
Eb                              D7        Gm
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
    Eb                                         D
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose

Gm
People are crazy and times are strange
    Cm
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
  Gm                D7          Gm
I used to care, but things have changed
     
Gm  Cm  Gm D7  Gm    

Gm
This place ain't doing me any good
Cm
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
           Gm                                     D
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gm
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag
Cm
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
       Gm                                D7          Gm
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove
       Eb                             D7          Gm
Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Eb                                       D
Don t get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through

Gm
People are crazy and times are strange
Cm
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
  Gm                D7          Gm
I used to care, but things have changed
     
Gm  Cm  Gm D7  Gm    
          Gm 
I've been walking forty miles of bad road
       Cm
If the bible is right, the world will explode
          Gm                                         D
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Gm
Some things are too hot to touch
    Cm
The human mind can only stand so much
Gm                   D7     Gm
You can't win with a losing hand
Eb                                       D7      Gm
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Eb                                             D
Putting her in a wheel barrow and wheeling her down the street

Gm
People are crazy and times are strange
    Cm
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
  Gm                D7          Gm
I used to care, but things have changed
     
Gm  Cm  Gm D7  Gm    

  Gm
I hurt easy, I just don't show it
        Cm
You can hurt someone and not even know it
    Gm                                        D
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
          Gm
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
        Cm
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
    Gm                    D7           Gm
I'm love with a woman who don't even appeal to me
    Eb                       D7            Gm
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
Eb                              D
I'm not that eager to make a mistake

Gm
People are crazy and times are strange
    Cm
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
  Gm                D7          Gm
I used to care, but things have changed

Gm  Cm  Gm D7  Gm  . . .
