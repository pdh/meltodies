C            F                      C
This land is your land this land is my land
          G7                    C
From California to the New York Island
                 F                          C
From the Redwood Forests to the Gulf Stream waters
G7                             C
This land was made for you and me

         F                      C
As I was walking that ribbon of highway
      G7                  C
I saw above me an endless skyway
      F                 C
I saw below me a Golden Valley
G7                             C
This land was made for you and me

Repeat #1

             F                       C
I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
                      G7                   C
Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
        F                     C
And all around me a voice was sounding
G7                             C
This land was made for you and me

Repeat #1
