Intro   C  Fm  x3

Verse

C                 Bb   C7
I've been trowing horseshoes
F            G
Over my left shoulder
F             C 
I've spent most all my life
D7                G
Looking for that four-leafed clover
C              Bb  C7
When you run with me,
F          G
Chasing my rainbows
F             C
Honey I love you, too
G                       C
And that's the way love goes.

Chorus
C                   Bb    C7
That's the way love goes, babe
F            G
That's the music God made
F             C
For all the world to sing
D7                G
It never gets old; it grows
C              Bb   C7
Losing makes me sorry
F            G
You say, Honey, don't worry.
F             C
Honey, I love you, too
G                       C
And that's the way love goes.
