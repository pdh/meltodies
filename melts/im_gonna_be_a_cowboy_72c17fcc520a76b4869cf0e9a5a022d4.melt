I'm Gonna Be A Cowboy â€“ Marty Robbins

Intro:  2 bars   Eb

         Eb
I want a 10-gallon Stetson
      F
and a horse that bears my brand
  Bb
a thousand head of cattle
     Eb
on a great big piece of land
         G7
I want a ranch in Arizona
           Cm
where they never sleep inside
         F
I want a gaze at the moon and stars above
          Bb
I want to learn to rope and ride


I want two pearl handled six guns
the kind that really shoot
a saddle trimmed with silver
and a pair of yellow boots
     Ab                  Abm
I'll have my name carved on my belt
     Eb             C
I'll line my saddle seat with felt
    F          Bb             Eb
I'm gonna be a cowboy, yes sirree
