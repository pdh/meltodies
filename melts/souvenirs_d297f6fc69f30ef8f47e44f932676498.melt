Intro:
D   G   A7   D
D   G   A7   D


                           G      A7
All the snow has turned to water,
                             D
Christmas days have come and gone.
                G             A7                            D
Broken toys and faded colours are all that's left to linger on.
                          G           A7
I hate graveyards and old pawn shops,
                         D
For they always bring me tears.
                             G               A7             D
I can't forgive the way they robbed me of my childhood souvenirs.



Chorus:
A7                      D
Memories, they can't be boughten.
A7                                 D
They can't be won at carnivals for free.
A7                       D
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs,
      G                                     A7
And i don't know how they slipped away from me.



                        G        A7
Broken hearts and dirty windows
                       D
Make life difficult to see.
                               G        A7         
That's why last night and this morning
                        D
Always look the same to me.
                            G        A7
And I hate reading old love letters 
                         D
For they always bring me tears.
                            G          A7
I can't forget the way they robbed me,
                        D
Of my sweetheart's souvenirs.




A7                      D
Memories, they can't be boughten.
A7                                 D
They can't be won at carnivals for free.
A7                       D
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs,
      G                                     A7
And i don't know how they slipped away from me.
