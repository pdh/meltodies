Hurray, I awake from yesterday   Alive, but the war is here to stay
 B
So my love, Catherina and me,
  Bb
decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea
A                             Ab
Not to die but to reborn,  away from lands so battered and torn
  Abm        Db      Abm Db C
Forever, forever
 Db
Oh say, can you see it's really such a mess 
          Cm 
  Every inch of Earth is a fighting nest
       B
Giant pencil and lipstick tube shaped things,
   Bb
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
           A
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red as our 
 Ab                                              Abm    Db       Abm    Db
feet find the sand,  and the sea is straight ahead, straight up ahead
      Dbm                      Abm           B      
Well it's too bad that our friends, can't be with us today

Well it's too bad
   Dbm               Abm
The machine, that we built,
   B                   Gb
would never save us', that's what they say

That's why they ain't coming with us today
                          Dbm                     Abm
And they also said it's impossible for a man to live and breathe under
               B
water,      forever, was their main complaint
 Gb
And they also threw this in my face, they said:
  Dbm                             Abm
Anyway, you know good and well it would be beyond the will of God,
  B                                 Gb
and the grace of the King grace of the King  Yeah, yeah

So my darling and I make love in the sand,
   Cm
to salute the last moment ever on dry land
   B
Our machine, it has done its work, played its part well
           Bb
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
   A
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
    Ab
Before our heads go under we take a last look at the killing noise
  Abm                    Db            Abm         Abm Db...
Of the out of style, the out of style, out of style
   Db                                    Cm
So down and down and down and down and down and down  we go
   B                                Bb
hurry my darling we mustn't be late for the show
   A                                  Ab
Neptune champion games  to an aqua world that's so very dear
  Gb                                    Ab      B   Gb       Ab
right this way smiles a mermaid I can hear atlantis full of cheer
