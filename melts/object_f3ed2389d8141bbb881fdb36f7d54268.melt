*** CAPO 3RD FRET ***

Am

                         Am                             F
You're just an object to me, I'd like to get to know you better
           C           G                          Am
Baste you across my body, you're just an object to me

                       Am              F
You're just a piece of meat, and I am a butcher
           C                   G                              F
I love you better, love you forever, you're just an object to me


C              E7
Why sit in the shade
              Am          G       F
Drink what we made from a lover's cup
                    C                        G
Dreams don't always come when you fall asleep
                         Am
You're just an object to me


(solo over verse)  Am   F    C    G    F


I'm gonna do something wrong, nobody's gonna like it
But I've got my pride, and my time isn't free, you're just an object to me

You're just an object to me, I feel a little better
They found your sweater, you're just an object to me

End on Am
