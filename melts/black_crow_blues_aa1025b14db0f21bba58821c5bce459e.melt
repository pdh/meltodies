I woke in the mornin', wand'rin',

Wasted and worn out.

Wishin' my long-lost lover
     D7
Will walk to me, talk to me,
                       G7    D7
Tell me what it's all about.



G7
I was standin' at the side road
C7                           G7
Listenin' to the billboard knock.

D7
Well, my wrist was empty

But my nerves were kickin',
                  G7  D7  
Tickin' like a clock.



G7
If I got anything you need, babe,
C7                        G7
Let me tell you in front.

D7
You can come to me sometime,

Night time, day time,
             G7   D7
Any time you want.



G7
Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm
C7                 G7
Too high to fall.

D7
Other times I'm thinkin' I'm

So low I don't know
                  G7    D7
If I can come up at all.



G7
Black crows in the meadow
C7                     G7
Across a broad highway.

D7
Though it's funny, honey,

I just don't feel much like a
            G7  D7
Scarecrow today.

Enjoy!
