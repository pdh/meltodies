[D] Why do you treat me as if I were only a [A] friend
What have I done that has made you so diff'-[A7] rent and [D] cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be content-[D7] ed a-[G] gain
[A] Will you be happy when you are wither-[A7] ed and [D] old?

I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves
But if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Think of the heartaches, the tears and the sorrows you'll save.

When you are lonely and tired of another man's gold
When you are weary, remember this letter, my own
Don't try to answer though I suffer anguish untold
If you don't love me, I wish you would leave me alone.

While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you are breaking so free
But to this world I will soon say my farewell, at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me.

Repeat 1st verse.
