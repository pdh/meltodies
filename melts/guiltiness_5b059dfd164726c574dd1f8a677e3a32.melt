Dm 
Guiltiness (talkin' 'bout guiltiness)
                          Am 
Pressed on their conscience. Oh yeah, oh yeah!. 
Dm 
And they live their lives (they live their lives) 
                      Am 
On false pretence everyday;  each and everyday. Yeah. 
 

Dm 
These are the big fish 
                                   Am 
Who always try to eat down the small fish, just the small fish. 
Dm 
I tell you what: they would do anything 
                          Am 
To materialize their every wish. Oh yeah-eah-eah-eah. 
 
C                 Am 
Say: Woe to the downpressors: 
F                          G 
They'll eat the bread of sorrow! 
C                 Am 
Woe to the downpressors: 
   F                           G 
They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow! 
C                 Am 
Woe to the downpressors: 
 F                           G 
They'll eat the bread of sorrow! 
      Am 
Oh, yeah-eah! Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah! 
 

Dm 
Guiltiness 
                        Am 
Pressed on their conscience. Oh yeah. Oh yeah
