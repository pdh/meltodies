I Am A Rock chords
Simon and Garfunkel

Capo I

D 
A winter's day
     G               D      
In a deep and dark December;

Em A  G D
I  am alone,
Em             A      Em                A
Gazing from my window to the streets below
     Em             G                A
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.

       D 
I am a rock,
        A  D    
I am an is-land.

           D    
I've built walls,
  G                 D      
A fortress deep and mighty,
     Em   A   G   D  
That none may penetrate.
  Em              A           Em                A
I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain.
      Em               G           A
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.

       D 
I am a rock,
        A  D    
I am an is-land.

              D    
Don't talk of love,
     G                 D      
I've heard the words before;
     Em   A         G   D  
It's sleeping in my memory.
      Em                A          Em                 A
And I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
     Em            G                A
If I never loved I never would have cried.

       D 
I am a rock,
        A  D    
I am an is-land.

          D    
I have my books
       G            D      
And my poetry to protect me;
     Em   A         G   D  
I am shielded in my armor,
Em           A     Em             A 
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.
  Em               G              A
I touch no one and no one touches me.

       D 
I am a rock,
        A  D    
I am an is-land.

      G     F#m      D
And a rock  feels no pain;
       G      F#m   D
And an island never cries.
