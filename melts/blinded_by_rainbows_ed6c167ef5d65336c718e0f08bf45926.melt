Verse:
      
                      G

Did you ever feel the pain

                      C

That he felt upon the cross

                      Dsus4 D

Did you ever feel the knife

                         C

Tearing flesh that's all so soft

                       Em    C

Did you ever touch the night

                       Em    C 

Did you ever count the cost

                     Em      C*

Do you hide away the feeling

                     Dsus4    D

Put down paradise as lost

Chorus:

            G          D   C

Yeah you're blinded by rainbows

G            D    C

Watching the wind blow

G          D   C

Blinded by rainbows

       Em

Do you dream at night?  Do you sleep at night?

  C

I doubt it . . .
