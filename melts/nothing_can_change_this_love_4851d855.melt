A  D  A  E7

     A		 C#7
If I go a million miles away
	    D		    B7
I'd write a letter, each and every day
        A     F#7
'Cause honey, nothing,
	B7		    E7		   A   D
Nothing can ever change this love I have for you


	A		C#7
Make me weep and you can make me cry
        D		 B7
See me comin' and you can pass me by
    A	   F#7
But honey, nothing
	B7		    E7		   A   D	
Nothing can ever change this love I have for you


A	   D	       E7	 F#m
you're the apple of my eye, you're cherry pie
	     E7		    AM7
and oh yeah, you're cake and ice cream
A6      C#7	       A	       F#m
You're sugar and spice and everything nice
B7		  E7  D	    A/C#
You re the girl of my dreams


    Bm7 A  		 C#7
But if you wanted to leave me and roam
          D		       B7
When you get back, I'd just say "Welcome Home"
	     A	     F#7
'cause honey nothing, nothing
    B7		     E7		    A   D  A
can ever change this love I have for you
