Hello Mary Lou
(Creedence Clearwater Revival)



 A             D
Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart,
  A                              E
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you,
  A             A7           D  
I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part,
 A         E            A
Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart  (3x last) 



A
Past me by one sunny day,
D
Flashed those big brown eyes my way,
  A                           E
I knew I wanted you for evermore,
A
I'm not one that tears around,
D
Swear my feet stuck to the ground,
    A             E            A
Though I never did meet you before,



Chorus

A
I saw your lips, I heard your voice,
D
Believe me I just had no choice,
A                                 E
Wild horses couldnâ€™t make me stay away,
A
I thought about a moon lit night,
D
My arms around you good and tight,
    A            E             A       
And all I had to see for me to say,




Chorus
