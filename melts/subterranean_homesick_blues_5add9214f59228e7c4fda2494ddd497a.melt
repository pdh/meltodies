Subterranean Homesick Blues chords
Bob Dylan

Capo V

E7 E

E7                       E
Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
E7                  E
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
E7                          E
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
E7                         E
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
A7
Look out kid, it's something you did
E7                         E
God knows when, but you're doing it again
           E7                      E    
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
    B7
The man in the coonskin cap in the pig pen
      E7                       E
Wants eleven dollar bills, but you only got ten


Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talking that the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A.

Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don't try No Doz
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

Ah, get sick, get well, hang around the Ink Well
Ring a bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail

Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
But losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, and watch your parking meters

Ah get born, keep warm, short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift

Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handle
