Kneeling Drunkard's Plea (Written by June, Helen and Anita Carter)
        --  Johnny Cash (Unchained Album)

        C         G
Chorus: Lord have mercy on me
                D5         C
was the kneelin drunkard's plea
                      D5     D 
and as he knelt there on the ground
  C                G             C
I know that God in Heaven looked down {X2 last time}

        C                     G
1.      I went down by an old country church
                   D5          C
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
                      D5      D
and as he reached his mothers grave
  C                 G         C
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray
(Chorus)

2.      Bring my darlin boy to me
was his mothers dyin plea
and as staggered through the gate
alas he came just one day too late

3.      Three years have passed since she went away
her son is sleepin beside her today
and I know in heaven his mother will see
for God has heard that drunkard's plea
(Chorus)

D5 X0023X   - I think it is some D chord and this is the best one
