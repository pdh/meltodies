A.      xx    E /  
  Anger,   he smiles,
            F#m /                 D /
towering in shiny metallic purple armour
      A /            E /
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
    F#m /                   D             C#
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
D /            A /                          Bm /
  Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
             G /
They quietly understand
D /                  A /                 Bm /
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
                   G     G#   A /
But wonder why the fight is   on

            E /         F#m /  G G#
But they're all bold as love, 
A /             E /         F#m / G G# 
  Yeah, they're all bold as love
A /             E /         F#m.
  Yeah, they're all bold as love
D /             A / Bm / D / G G# 
  Just ask the axis

   A /       E /                                   F#m /
My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
               D /
and ribbons of euphoria
A /              E /
Orange is young, full of daring,
    F#m /                 D        C#
But very unsteady for the first go round
D /               A /
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
Bm /                           G /
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
    D /                   A /                               
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, 
Bm /                G            G#   
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

           A /   E /               F# /  G    G#
But I'm a, yeah,  I'm bold bold as love, yeah yeah 
A /         E /          F# / G G#
  Well I'm bold, bold as love
A /     E /     F#m.
    I'm bold as love
D /          A /   Bm /        D /         G    G#   (A)
Just ask the axis,    he knows everything, yeah yeah yeah....
