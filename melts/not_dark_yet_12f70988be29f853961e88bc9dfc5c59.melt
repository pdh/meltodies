E                   A                      E   
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day
                          A               E
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away
B            B/A      B/G#             E    
Feel like my soul has turned into steel_
C#m                 B              A          E
I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal
B                B/A         B/G#        E     
There's not even room enough to be anywhere
C#m           B         A           E
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

E                      A                    E
Well my sense of humanity is going down the drain
E                             A                         E
Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain
B              B/A            B/G#             E
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
C#m             B                A      E
She put down in writin' what was in her mind
B                B/A    B/G#           E   
I just don't see why I should even care
C#m            B             A      E
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

E                     A                 E
Well I been to London and I been to gay Paris
E                    A                E
I followed the river and I got to the sea
B                     B/A         B/G#              E
I've been down to the bottom of a world full of lies
C#m                B          A        E
I ain't lookin for nothin' in anyone's eyes
B            B/A       B/G#                 E
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
C#m            B        A           E
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

E                                  A          E
I was born here and I'll die here, against my will
E                               A                E
I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still
B                 B/A         B/G#         E
Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb
C#m                           B                  A            E
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
B          B/A      B/G#          E
Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer
C#m           B             A       E
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there
