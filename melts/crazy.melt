CRAZY is a ballad composed by Willie Nelson. It has been recorded by several artists,
most notably by Patsy Cline, whose version was a #2 country hit in 1962. Patsy Cline, who
was already a country music superstar and working to extend a string of hits, picked it
as a follow up to her previous big hit I Fall to Pieces. "Crazy", its complex melody
suiting Cline's vocal talent perfectly, was released in late 1961 and immediately became
another huge hit for Cline and widened the crossover audience she had established with
her prior hits. It spent 21 weeks on the chart and eventually became one of her
signature tunes. Cline's version is #85 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest 
Songs of All Time.
