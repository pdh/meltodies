#1.

A                                                            D
Well now baby you're a looker and I know what you're looking for
         A                             E7
You been looking over every man at the bar
A                                      D
Well honey I know I got a few years on you
              A                      E7                  A
But if you're shopping around let me tell you a thing or two  


(*Note, pickup tempo to full as go into 2nd verse, singing and playing.)


#2.

                                                    D
Well I look a little rough and I got a few miles on me
        A                                             E7
My body needs work and my style ain't what to used to be
    A                                                 D
And honey I'll admit there's places where I'm wearing thin
      A                E7                     A
But I ain't broke down I'm just good'n broken in


Chorus


       D                                 A
Well I may be worn but baby I ain't worn out
                                                              E7
Let me take you for a ride and I'll show you what I'm talking about
D                                       A   (*Note, very short pause here)
I guarantee there's a lot of me left to love

D (single stroke) A                      E7                A
------------------Well I may be used but baby I ain't used up


Instrumental


#3.

                                                D
I been wrecked a few times and honey it shows I guess
        A                                                     E7
There's been once or twice that you could say that I was repossessed
        A                                              D
There's one little thing that I think ought to be understood
   A                       E7                      A
It ain't how you look it's what you got under your hood


Chorus


       D                                 A
Well I may be worn but baby I ain't worn out
                                                              E7
Let me take you for a ride and I'll show you what I'm talking about
D                                       A   (*Note, very short pause here)
I guarantee there's a lot of me left to love

D (single stroke) A                      E7                A
------------------Well I may be used but baby I ain't used up


Instrumental to 'fade' ending.
