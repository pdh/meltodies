            G          Em
Just let me love you tonight
Am(/C) D           G  Em
    Forget about tomorrow
Am(/C) D              G        Em
    My darlin' let me hold you tight
    C G/B Am  D  G       C/G  G
And never let me go

Dry your eyes
No tears and no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go

G7
  C                Cm
A million times or more dear
    G         D     G        G7
You said we'd never part
    B7       Em
But lately I find
  A7             D    C    G/B    D9
A stranger in my arms


Give me the right
In summer or in spring-time
To tell the world that you are mine
And never let me go.

C  G/B  Am D  G
