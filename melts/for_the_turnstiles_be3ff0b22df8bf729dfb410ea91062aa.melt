G          F               D   
All the sailors with their seasick mamas
hear the sirons on the shore
singing songs for pimps with tailors
who charge ten dollars at the door

~chorus~

G          F             D
you can really learn alot that way
G          F              D
it will change you in the middle of the day
G          F              D
though your confidence may be shattered
C         G        D
it doesnt matter 

All the great explorers 
are now in granite lake
under white sheets for the great unveiling
at the big parade

~chorus~

G         F         D
All the bush league batters
are left to die on the diamond 
in the stands the home crowd scatters
C         G         D
for the turnstiles       x3
