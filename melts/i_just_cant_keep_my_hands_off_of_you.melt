#1.

A                A7          D
You know I can't stand to be around you
          A                           E7
Cause you know I'm still in love with you
       A                                D
And my arms keep reaching to do what my thoughts do all the time
       E7                         A
I just can't keep my hands off of you


Chorus
                D                           A
Cause it's like looking at heaven while I'm standing in hell
   E7                              A     A7
We shared something precious for a while
         D                     A
You look just like a baby in a cradle to me
      E7                              A
And I just can't keep my hands off of you


#2
                     A7                 D
Woman you've got the man inside my body tremblin'
    A                     E7
The way only you know how to
      A                                  D
And I guess that's just one of a million reasons
       E7                         A
I just can't keep my hands off of you


Chorus
                D                           A
Cause it's like looking at heaven while I'm standing in hell
   E7                              A     A7
We shared something precious for a while
         D                     A
You look just like a baby in a cradle to me
      E7                              A
And I just can't keep my hands off of you
