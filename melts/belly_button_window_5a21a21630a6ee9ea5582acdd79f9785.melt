Belly Button Window - Jimi Hendrix

         B7
Well. Im up here in this womb
       A7             E
Im looking all around
            B7
Well, Im looking out my belly button window
       A7                  E
And I see a whole lot of frowns
           B7                  A7          E
And Im wondering if they dont want me around

What seems to be the fuzz out there? 
Just what seems to be the hang? 
cause you know if ya just dont want me this time around,
Yeah Ill be glad to go back to spirit land
And even take a longer rest,
Before Im coming down the chute again
Man, I sure remember the last time, baby
They were stlll hawkin about me then
So if you dont want me now,
Make up your mind, where or when
If you dont want me now,
Give or take, you only got two hundred days
cause I aint coming down this way too much more again

You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
But I think youre just a little too late
So Im coming down into this world, daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And Im gonna sit up in your bed, mama
And just a grin right in your face
And then Im gonna eat up all your chocolates,
And say i hope Im not too late

So if theres any questions,
Make up your mind
cause you better give or take
Questions in your mind
Give it a take,
You only got two hundered days

Way up into this womb
Looking all around
Sures dark in here
And Im looking out my belly button window
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns
And Im wondering if they want me around
