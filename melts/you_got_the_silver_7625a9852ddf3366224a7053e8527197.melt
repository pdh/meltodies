Hey babe, what's in your eyes?
               Bb                   F
I saw them flashing like airplane lights
             Bb                     F
You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
              Bb               C
I must come back for a little more

(instrumental break, no, chords)

              F
You got my heart you got my soul
              Bb                 F
You got the silver you got the gold
               Bb               F
You got the diamonds from the mine
                  Bb                   C
Well that's all right, it'll buy some time

F Bb F Bb F Bb C

           F
Tell me, honey, what will I do
           Bb                F
When I'm hungry and thirsty too
           Bb                    F
Feeling foolish (and that's for sure)
              Bb                    C
Just waiting here at your kitchen door?

(instrumental break, no, chords)

      F                   
Hey baby, what's in your eyes?
               Bb              F
Is that the diamonds from the mine?
               Bb              F
What's that laughing in your smile?
         Bb                C
I don't care, no, I don't care
     
(instrumental break, no, chords)

     F
Oh babe, you got my soul
              Bb                F
You got the silver you got the gold
                Bb                   F
If that's your love, just leave me blind
         Bb                        C
I don't care, no, that's no big surprise

(instrumental break, no, chords)
