E
Train of love's a comin', big black wheels a hummin',
A
People waitin' at the station, happy hearts are drummin'.
E
Train man, tell me maybe, ain't you got my baby?
B7
Ev'ry so often ev'rybody's baby gets the urge to roam,
                                                               E
But ev'rybody's baby but mine's comin' home.

           E
Now, stop your whistle blowin', 'cause I've got ways of knowin',
            A
You're bringin' other people's lovers but my own keeps goin'.
E
Train of love deceivin', when she's not gone she's leavin'.
B7
Ev'ry so often ev'rybody's baby gets the urge to roam,
                                                               E
But ev'rybody's baby but mine's comin' home.

Here and there and ev'rywhere there's gonna be embracin'.

E
Train of love's a leavin', leavin' my heart grievin'.
       A
But early or late I sit and wait because I'm still believin'.
         E
We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever.
B7
Ev'ry so often ev'rybody's baby gets the urge to roam,
                                                               E
But ev'rybody's baby but mine's comin' home.
