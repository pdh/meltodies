E                              A
Bessie was a lovely child from west Tennessee
B7                  E
Leroy was an outlaw hard and mean
                                   A
One day she saw him staring and it chilled her to the bone
        B7                                              E
And she knew she had to see that look on a child of her own

             A
Cause ladies love outlaws
     B7          E
Like babies love stray dogs
                           A
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
    B7                                                    E
And outlaws touch the ladies somewhere deep down in their soul

                 A
Linda was a lady blonde and built to last
B7                                E
Benny was a no good guitar picker running from his past
                                   A
She heard all of his songs telling nothing but bad news
        B7                                        E
But she made her mind up to try to get him win or lose

Repeat #2

                              A
Jessi like the Cadillac's and diamonds on her hand
B7                       E
Waymore had a reputation as a ladies man
                               A
Late one night a light of love finally gave a sign
B7                                              E
Jessi parked her Cadillac and took her place in line

Repeat #2
