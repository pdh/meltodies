C                                  C
She don't like her eggs all runny, She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
F                                 C
She looks down her nose at money, She gets it on like the Easter Bunny,
G                             G                           C
She's my baby, I'm her honey, I ain't never gonna let her go.

C                                        
He ain't got laid in a month of sundays, 
C
caught him once he was sniffing my undies
F                                           C
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done, drinks his beer like its oxygen
G                                G                   C
He's my baby, and I'm his honey, Never gonna let him Go

Chorus:
C           F                                    C
In spite of ourselves, we'll end up sittin' on a rainbow
            G                              C                  F
Against all odds, Honey we're the big door prize, weâ€™re gonna spite, our
                       C                                         G
noses right off of our faces, There won't be nothing but big old hearts
               C
dancing in our eyes.

Instrumental break:
C  |  F  |  C   |    F    |    C    |    F   |   C   |   C   |    G

Rest of the song continues as normal:

C                                  C
She thinks all my jokes are corny, Convict movies make her horny,
F                                        C
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs, swears like a sailor when she

shaves her legs.
G                                                              C
She takes a lickin', and keeps on tickin', Never gonna let her go

C                                            
He's got more balls than a big brass monkey, 
C

He's a whacked out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
F                              C
Sly as a fox, Crazy as a loon, Payday comes and he's a-howling at the moon,
G                                                     C
He's my baby, I don't mean maybe, Never gonna let him go

Chorus x 2 and fade out.
