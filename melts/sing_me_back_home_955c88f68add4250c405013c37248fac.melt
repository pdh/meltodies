                  Merle Haggard - Sing me back home



These are the chords for the version of the song
he did with johnny cash



G                   D               C              G
The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
                                     D
I stood up to say good-bye like all the rest
G                          D           C                  G
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
                        D           G
Let my guitar playing friend do my request. 


 G             D          C              G
Sing me back home with a song I used to hear
                           D
Make my old memories come alive
G        D        C             G
Take me away and turn back the years
G             D             G
Sing Me Back Home before I die

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from 'cross the street
Came to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers 'There's a song my mama sang.
Can I hear once before we move along?'

Sing me back home, the song my mama sang
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die

Sing Me Back Home before I die
