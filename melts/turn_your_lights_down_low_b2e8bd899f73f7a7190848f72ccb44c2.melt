rap:
lovin you was like the song that we play
every three minutes and thirty seconds every day
and every chorus was written for us to recite right
and a beautiful melody of devotion every night
this potion might this ocean might carry me
in the wave of emotion i asked you to marry me
and every word every second and every third
expresses the hapiness more clearly than ever heard
and when i play 'em every chord is a poem
telling the lord how greatful i am 'coz i know him
the harmonies stress a sensations to my love to your corres
if you asking then i'm telling you yes
standing love take my hand and love ja blast

i want to give you some good good lovin
