Verse

C
I don't wanna leave you on the farm
C                             Am
I don't wanna leave you on the farm
C             Am
I don't wanna go
G             F
Oh just so you know
C                             Am
I don't wanna leave you on the farm

Chorus

Am       Em
Days go by
F             C
And I'm still high
Am           F                  C
But you know I'm thinkin' about you
Am         Em
Corns turn brown
F                   C
Leaves fall to the ground
Am                G             C
It's a sound that reminds me of you

Verse

C
I don't wanna leave you on the farm

I don't wanna go
G             F

I don't wanna leave you on the farm

Chorus

Am      Em
No telephone
F               C
To call you at home
Am       F        C
I'm alone on the throne
Am      Em
Go get somethin
F               C
Hey, thanks for nothin
Am             G                    C
I'll keep truckin and gettin myself stoned

Leaves fall to the ground
Am                G             C
It's a sound that sticks like glue
