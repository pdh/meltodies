Grey Walls 
 
F#m               A                       G
I took my darling down, I took my darling down
To that big grey house down the lane
F#m                 A                         G
And then the doctor said, he said "It's in her head
She's never going to be right again"
Am		      D    Am		        D
I kissed my love goodbye, she didn't blink an eye
Am		        D 				 B
They took her down the hall, she never looked back at all

Chorus:
     G         Dm
Oh behind grey walls, somewhere there's a soul
  G         Dm
Behind grey walls, she's out of control
Em7
She's crying out for help, no-one can hear
A7			  B
O Lord have pity on her, O Lord have pity on her

My darling walks the floor, my darling walks the floor
She walks every minute that she can
I heard my darling say, I heard my darling say 
That she don't know who I am
Cigarette burns down her arm, said she tried to do herself harm
Tied her arms in the back, trussed her up like a sack

Chorus

I saw my darling's face, I saw my darling's face
It looked so pale in the distance
She stared out from her room into the dying gloom
And I saw her poor tears glisten
Pills to keep her calm, more punctures than a junkie in her arm
Strapped her on the bed, seventy volts through her head

Chorus
