PARDON MY HEART- Neil Young

TUNING: D A D G B D

        D                 CaddD    G/D             D  G/D  CaddD
It's a fallen situation, when all eyes are turned in
        D                 CaddD      G/D        D   G/D  CaddD
And a love isn't flowing the way it could have been

      D11
(You brought it all on)
            D
Oh, but it feels so wrong
      D11
(You brought it all on)
                     D
No, no, no, I don't believe this song
      D11             (n.C.)
(You brought it all on)

D  D6 D11(2) A11/D D(2) D11 D   D11(2) Dsus4/B

It's a sad communication with little reason to believe
When one isn't giving and one pretends to receive

(You brought it all on)
Oh, but it feels so wrong
(You brought it all on)
No, no, no, I don't believe this song
(You brought it all on)

D  D6 D11(2) A11/D D(2) D11 D   D Am7
D  D6 D11(2) A11/D D(2) D11 D   D Am7

(You brought it all on)
(You brought it all on)
(You brought it all on)

Pardon my heart if I showed that I cared
But I love you more than moments we have or have not shared

(You brought it all on)
Oh, and it feels so good
(You brought it all on)
When love flows the way that it should
(You brought it all on)
It feels so good
You feel good
You feel good
