Guess Things Happen That Way
Johnny Cash

          A                 D          A
Well, you ask me if I'll forget my baby
A              D
I guess I will some day
A                     E                        A  (E)
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

    A              D          A
You ask me if I'll get along
A              D
I guess I will some way
A                     E                        A  (E)
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

CHORUS:
D                A                E              A        D
God gave me that girl to lean on, then he put me on my own
D              A            E                    A
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone
A                     E                        A  (E)
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will every day
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll find another
I don't know, I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

CHORUS
