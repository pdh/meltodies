--- I did not find the chords for this song on the internet,  ---
--- so i picked a guitar and figured them out.                --- 
--- Then I thought they could be useful for some other people,---
--- so, here they are.                                        ---


MY RAINBOW RACE - PETE SEEGER

A            Bm       E                     A
One blue sky above us, one ocean lapping all our shore
F#m           Bm            E                   A
One earth so green and round, who could ask for more?
               Bm     E                      A
And because I love you I'll give it one more try
F#m         Bm          E                 A
To show my rainbow race, it's too soon to die

[Chords are in the same sequence for the rest of the song]

Some folks want to be like an ostrich
Bury their heads in the sand
Some hope that plastic dreams
Can unclench all those greedy hands
Some hope to take the easy way
Poisons, bombs, they think we need 'em
Don't you know you can't kill all the unbelievers?
There's no shortcut to freedom

One blue sky above us, one ocean lapping all our shore
One earth so green and round, who could ask for more?
And because I love you I'll give it one more try
To show my rainbow race, it's too soon to die

Go tell, go tell all the little children
Tell all the mothers and fathers too
Now's our last chance to learn to share
What's been given to me and you

One blue sky above us, one ocean lapping all our shore
One earth so green and round, who could ask for more?
And because I love you I'll give it one more try
To show my rainbow race, it's too soon to die

One blue sky above us, one ocean lapping all our shore
One earth so green and round, who could ask for more?
