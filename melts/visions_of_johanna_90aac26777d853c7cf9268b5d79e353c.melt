Visions of Johanna chords
Bob Dylan

A D E7 A

         A                           D                  E7              A
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
                                   D             E7        A
We sit here stranded, though we're all doing our best to deny it
        E                                    E7       A
And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
       D                         A
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
   D                             A
in this room the heat pipes just cough,
    D                           A
the country music station plays soft,
                                            E7
but there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
         A          D     E7   A
Just Louise and her lover so entwined,
          D             A         E7         A    D E7 A
and these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.

             A                         D           E7             A
In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key chain
                              D              E7                A
And the all night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
       E
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight,
                                                A
ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
   D                                A
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
      D                           A
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
             D                                A
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear,
                   E7
that Johanna's not here
    A                    D            E7           A
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face,
            D             A             E7       A     D E7 A
where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.

     A                   D                E7     A
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
                           D             E7       A
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
         E                                                    A
And when bringing her name up he speaks of a farewell kiss to me
     D                A
He's sure got a lotta gall,
   D                 A
to be so useless and all,
D                           A
muttering small talk at the wall,
                 E7
while I'm in the hall
    A                          D       E7  A
Oh, how can I explain, it's so hard to get on?
          D             A                  E7          A    D E7 A
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.

           A        D        E7         A
Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
                            D              E7           A
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
         E                                                                 A
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles
        D                    A
See the primitive wallflower freeze,
         D                     A
when the jelly faced women all sneeze,
         D                           A                      E7
hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeeze, I can't find my knees"
    A                     D             E7          A
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
          D            A                  E7          A    D E7 A
But these visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel.

    A                         D                 E7                  A
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
         A
Saying' "Name me someone that's not a parasite,
            D             E7         A
and I'll go out and say a prayer for him." But like Louise
E
always says, "Ya can't look at much, can ya man?" as she, herself, 
   A
prepares for him
      D                        A
And Madonna, she still has not showed
            D                 A
We see this empty cage now corrode
          D                          A
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
    D                            A
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
          D                                    A
he writes everything s been returned which was owed,
       D                           A                           E7
on the back of the fish truck that loads while my conscience explodes
       A                D        E            A
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain,
          D             A            E7         A
and these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
