Title:				MY BACK PAGES		            (B. Dylan)

		E E5 E E5
		
	    E       C#m        G#m                       A      B      E     E5
	    Crimson flames run through my years, flowing high &amp; mighty trapped
	    E         C#m      G#m                 A           B
	    Countless fire and flaming rope, using ideas as my map
	    C#m                      G#m          A               B
	    We'll meet our own edges soon said I, proud me beaded brow


		           E             A     E
	    CHORUS: Ah but I was so much older then
		        A       B         E   E5 E E5
		    I'm younger than that now.


	    E         C#m       G#m              A        B      E     E5
	    Half ripe prejudice leapt forth, rip down all hate I scream
	    E         C#m     G#m                    A               B
	    Lies that life is black and white, spoke from my skull I dreamed
	    C#m                G#m             A               B
	    Romantic flanks of musketeers, foundation deep somehow

	    CHORUS

	    E             C#m      G#m                A       B        E   E5
	    In a soldiers stance I aim my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach
	    E              C#m       G#m          A              B
	    During night I become my enemy in the instant that I preach
	    C#m             G#m              A                    B
	    Sisters fled by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow
 
	    CHORUS

	    E               C#m       G#m                 A     B    E    E5
	    The guard stood hard when abstract prints too nobel to neglect
	    E           C#m  G#m             A               B
	    Deceived me into thinking, I had something to protect
	    C#m              G#m                   A                    B
	    Good and bad I define these terms, why clear, no doubt, somehow.

                        MY BACK PAGES (Dylan)

  D       Bm     G     D                    
Crimson flames tied through my ears

         G         D    Em7      A7
Rollin' high and mighty traps...      

  D           Bm     G     D
Pounced with fire on flaming roads

      G      D     Em7      A7
Using i-deas as my maps...

        D         F#m  G          D
"We'll meet on edges, soon said," I,

 Em7         A7  Em7         A7
Proud 'neath heated brow...

        D     D7       G     D
Ah, but I was so much older then

     Em7      A7   G    D
I'm young-er than that now.


Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth,
"Rip down all hate," I screamed,
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull I dreamed.
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Girl's faces formed the forward path
&gt;From phony jealousy,
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history.
Flung down by corpse evangelist
Unthought of, though, somehow,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school.
"Equality," I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.


In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach.
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guards stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect.
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.




....I think Dylan did it in Eb...
....The Byrds left out the 3rd and 4th verse in their
rendition...
....Amazing isn't it; a song thirty years old and still
just as relevant today.
