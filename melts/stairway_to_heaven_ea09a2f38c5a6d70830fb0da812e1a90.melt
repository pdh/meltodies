"Stairway to Heaven"

          Am(5th)    C+/G#(5th)    C/G         D/F#
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
          Fmaj7                   G  Am (slide from open A,8th then 7th)
And she's buying the stairway to heaven. 
         Am             C+/G#         C/G             D/F#      
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed 
       Fmaj7                     G    Am
With a word she can get what she came for. 
C D   Fmaj7  Am         C          G           Dsus4 D
Ooh,  ooh,    and she's buying the stairway to heaven. 

          C           D            Fmaj7       Am
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 
           C              D              Fmaj7
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
     Am          C+/G#            C/G          D/F#
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, 
          Fmaj7                      G  Am
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 

Am7(with E string on 3rd fret)

Dsus4 D               Am7        Em/D D(5th) C/D D(5th)
Ooh,         it makes me wonder, 
Am7 Dsus4 D           Am7        Em/D D(5th) C/D D(5th)
Ooh,         it makes me wonder. 

          C         G/B        Am
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, 
       C         G/B        Fmaj7 Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
      C               G/B           Am  
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, 
        C         G/B             Fmaj7 Am     C G/B  Am7
And the voices of those who stand looking. 

Dsus4 D              Am7              Em/D D C/D D
Ooh,        it makes me wonder, 
Am7 Dsus4 D          Am7              Em/D D C/D D 
Ooh,        it really makes me wonder. 

         C              G/B         Am
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune 
          C         G/B        Fmaj7 Am
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
      C            G/B      Am
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long 
        C            G/B       Fmaj7 Am      C G/B Am7  Dsus4 D  Em/D D C/D D
And the forests will echo with laughter. 

C            G/B                 Am
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, 
C           G/B                  Fmaj7 Am
It's just a spring clean for the May  queen. 
C               G/B              Am
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run 
C                 G/B                Fmaj7 Am          C G/B  Am7 Dsus4 D
and there's still time to change the road you're on. 

             Am7         Em/D D C/D D Am7 Dsus4 D
And it makes me wonder,
      Am7                Em/D D C/D D
oh. 

C             G/B           Am
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, 
C            G/B           Fmaj7 Am
The piper's calling you to join him, 
C          G/B              Am
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know 
C             G/B         Fmaj7  Am
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? 

 

Sorry, no solo. The rythm goes something like Am G F G
Great song by the way.

P.s. This is my first tab
