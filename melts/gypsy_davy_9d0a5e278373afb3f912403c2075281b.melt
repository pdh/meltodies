C
It was late last night when the boss come home

He's askin' about his lady
                                    G7      
The only answer he received, "she's gone with the
      C     G7                  C
Gypsy Davy, gone with the gypsy Dave"

"go saddle for me my buckskin' horse
And a hundred dollars saddle
Point out to me their wagon tracks
And after them I'll travel, after them I'll ride"

Well, I had not rode 'til the midnight moon
When I saw the campfire gleaming
I heard the notes of the big guitar
And the voice of the gypsy singin'
That song of the gypsy Dave

There in the light of the camping fire
I saw her fair face beaming
Her heart in tune with the big guitar
And the voice of the gypsy singing
That song of the gypsy Dave

Have you forsaken your house and home
Have you forsaken your baby
Have you forsaken your husband dear
To go to the gypsy Davey
And sing with the gypsy Dave
That song of the gypsy Dave

Yes, I've forsaken my husband dear
To go with the gypsy Davy
And I've forsaken my mansion high
But not my blue-eyed baby
Not my blue-eyed babe

She smiled to leave her husband dear
And go with the Gypsy Davy
But the tears come a-tricklin' down her cheeks
To think of the blue-eyed baby
Pretty little blue-eyed babe

Take off take off your buskin'gloves
Made of spanish leather
Give to me your lily-white hand
We'll ride back home together
And we'll ride home again

No, I won't take off my buskin' gloves
They're made of Spanish leather
I'll go my way from day to day
And sing with the gypsy Davy
That song of the gypsy Dave
That song of the gypsy Davey
That song of the gypsy Dave
