It's All Over Now:The Rolling Stones.
#1 in UK in 1964.

#1. (Capo 1st fret for original. See it on YouTube.)
      G
Well, baby used to stay out all night long,

she made me cry, she done me wrong.

She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie,
 
table's turned and now her turn to cry..

CHORUS:
          D                 C                 G
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.
          D                 C                 G
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now. 

#2.
G
Well, she used to run around with every man in town,

she spent all my money, playing her fast game.
 
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried,
 
Table's turnin' now it's her turn to cry..

CHORUS:
          D                 C                 G
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.
          D                 C                 G
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now. 

#3.
G
I used to wake in the morning, get my breakfast in bed.
 
When I got worried, she would ease my aching head.

But now she's here and there, with every man in town,
 
still trying to take me for that same old clown.

CHORUS:
          D                 C                 G
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.
          D                 C                 G
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now. 

ADD:
          D                 C                 G
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.
          D                 C                 G
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now. (x4)
