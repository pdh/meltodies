If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.

When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.

Kind woman, I give you my all, kind woman, nothing more. 

C                    G                    D
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by.

My love is strong, with you there is no wrong, 
  D
together we shall go until we die. My, my, my. 

   Bm                      E         Bm            E       A
An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look... see.

                 C            G                      D
Thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one.

Happiness, no more be sad, happiness....I'm glad.

If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.

When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me
