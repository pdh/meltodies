I could only find one version of this song around the net
and it wasn't even correct. I'm fairly certain this is 
pretty on. Feel free to correct, however.
Also, in between each verse, Dylan does this little riff. 
I'm not sure 100 % sure on what it is, but it's something
like this:

-2-2--2--3---5---3---2--0--2|
-3-3------------------------|
-2-2------------------------|
-0-0------------------------|
----------------------------|
----------------------------|

I just keep playing a D, suspend the 4th, 
slide up to the 4th fret(Esus4), go back to a D, suspend 
the 4th again again, then the 2nd, and back to a D.

However, feel free to improvise. Use a harmonica if you wish ;)
