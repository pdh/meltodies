         D                Em              G                     D
&gt;From the sun years of the Fifties and the birth of rock and roll,
A                                   D
Millions screamed to see him do his thing.
                  Em      G              D
Elvis touched the life of ev'ry ear that heard him,
                           A7             D
And they couldn't help but listen when he sang.
       G                             D          Em/A  D
It's a long way from Memphis to that mansion in the   sky,
       A                            D     D6 D7
But he kept his faith in Jesus all along,
D                                     D         Em/A  G
It's a long way from Graceland across Jordan to the   Promised Land,
    D            A       A7       D
But Jesus fin'ly came to lead him home.
