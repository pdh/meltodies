Bob Dylan 
Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You (1969)
(Bob Dylan)

From: "Nashville Skyline"
Live version from: “The Bootleg Series Vol. 05: Live 1975 - The Rolling Thunder Revue”

One of my Dylan favourites – especially the more passionate live version 
which has been released on volume 5 of the Bootleg Series (“Live 1975 – The
Rolling Thunder Revue”). The live version is not only in another key
but also features alternate lyrics and different chords, which is why I 
include a tab for this version, too. Enjoy!
