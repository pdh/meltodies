Intro:
G   C   D  C G
G   C   D    G


G
Well, he never got too lonely
C
And he never got too sad
D
But he never got too happy
C                          G
And that's what's just too bad
G
He never reached much further
C
Than his lonely arms would go
D
He wore a seatbelt around his heart
                           G
And they called him Safety Joe



Chorus:
G
Safety Joe
       C
Safety Joe
G
What do you say?
            D
What do you know?
             G
If you don't loosen up the buckle
              C
On your heart heart and start to chuckle
       D
You're gonna die of boredom
       G
Safety Joe



G
Now Joe he lived in Baltimore
C
'Cause New York was too darn fast
D            
He sometimes went down to Washington
        C                 G
Just to view our nation's past
G
He never ate his vegetables
C
Cause they were just too darn chewy
D 
And he never climbed much higher
                         G
Than the arch in old St. Louis




(Repeat Chorus 2x)



G
Joe gradually grew meaner
C
By not changin' his demeanor
D
But he never did nothin'
                 G
Too much for too long
G
Therefore his life never got much richer
C
Than the day they took that picture
D                                           G
In his birthday suit on the day that he was born.




(Repeat Chorus)




       D
You're gonna die of boredom
       G
Safety Joe



That's golden
