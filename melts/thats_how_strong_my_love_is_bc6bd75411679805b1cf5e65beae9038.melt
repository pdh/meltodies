Capo III

D G

G                D           C
If I was the sun way up there
                        G
I'd go with my love everywhere
           D                           C
I'd be the moon when the sun went down
                          G
Just to let them know I'm still around

                 D                 C
Cause that's how strong my love is,
           G
that's how strong my love is
           D                 C
That's how strong my love is,
           G
that's how strong my love is

G                         D                    C
I'd be the weeping willow drowning in my tears,
                     G
and you can swimming when you're here
           D                                  C
I'd be the rainbows when the tears have gone;
                         G
wrap you in my colors to keep you warm

                 D                 C
Cause that's how strong my love is,
           G
that's how strong my love is
           D                 C
That's how strong my love is,
           G
that's how strong my love is

Em              C
Like a ocean so deep and wide,
Em                         C
I'll catch your tears when ever you cry
Em                          C
I ll be the breeze when the storm is gone;
    D                 D7
and dry your eyes and keep you warm

                 D                 C
Cause that's how strong my love is,
           G
that's how strong my love is
           D                 C
That's how strong my love is,

           G
that's how strong my love is

Em              C
Like a ocean so deep and wide,
Em                         C
I'll catch your tears when ever you cry
Em                          C
I ll be the breeze when the storm is gone;
    D                 D7
and dry your eyes and keep you warm

                 D                 C
Cause that's how strong my love is,
           G
that's how strong my love is
