 Oh, Lonesome Me : After the Goldrush : Neil Young

 Intro: F Bb  (x2)

 F           Bb            F          Bb
 Everybody's going out and having fun 

 F              Bb          F           Bb
 I'm a fool for staying and having none 

   F              Fm             Bb   Bbm
 I can't get over how she set me free 

 Cm7  Bb  F          
 Oh,  oh, lonesome me

 F Bb
   
 There must be some way that I can lose
 These lonesome blues
 Forget about the past
 Find someone new
 I've tried everything from A to Z
 Oh, oh, lonesome me
 
 F Bb F Bb
        
      Bb                  C 
 I'll  bet she's not like me
       
       Am            Dm  
 She's out and fancy free
 
 Bb                      
   Flirting with the boys
              
              C     
 With all her charms

 But I still love her so
 And brother don't you know
 I'd welcome her right back here
 In my arms
                                       
 There must be some way that I can lose
 These lonesome blues
 Forget about the past
 I can't get over how she set me free
 Oh, oh, lonesome me
 
 F Bb F Bb
