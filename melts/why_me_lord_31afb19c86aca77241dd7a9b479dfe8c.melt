Verse 1:
                 G                    C/G
	Why me Lord? What have i ever done?
                        G
	To deserve even one
                               D
	Of the pleasures i've known
                 G                 C/G
	Tell me Lord.What did i ever do
                            G
	That was worth loving you
                 D              G
	Or the kindness you've shown


Chorus:
          C/G                    G                     D                 G
	Lord help me Jesus,i've wasted it so help me Jesus,i know what i am
          C/G               G                          D                     G
	Now that i know,that i needed you so help me Jesus,my soul's in your hands


Verse 2:
                G                        C/G
	Try me Lord.If you think there's a way
                        G
	I can't try to repay
                            D
	All i've taken from you
                G                    C/G
	Maybe Lord.I can show someone else
                                 G
	What i've been through myself
               D           G
	On my way back to you


Chorus (2 times).

And:
          D/                      G
	Jesus,my soul's in your hands.
