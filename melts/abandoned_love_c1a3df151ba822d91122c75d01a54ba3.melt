F Bb C F

F             C              Dm
I can see the turning of the key
     Gm                                   C
I ve been deceived by the clown inside of me
  Am                                  Bb
I thought that he was right but he's afraid 
    F          Bb      C                      F
But somethin's telling me I wear the ball and chain 

   F               C                 Dm
My patron saint is fighting with the ghost 
     Gm                                   C
He's always off somewhere when I need him most 
    Am                            Bb
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill 
       F        Bb      C             F
But my heart is telling me I love you still 

F           C            Dm
Everybody's wearin' a disguise 
   Gm                                      C
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes 
    Am                      Bb
But me I can't cover what I am 
    F        Bb       C              F
Wherever the children go I'll follow them 

  F              C            Dm
I march in the parade of liberty 
       Gm                         C
But as long as I love you I'm not free 
    Am                       Bb
How long must I suffer such abuse? 
          F      Bb       C                       F
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose? 
 
F C Dm Gm C Am Bb F C F

   F               C              Dm
We sat in an empty theatre and we kissed 
  Gm                                    C
I asked you please to cross me off your list 
   Am                                Bb
My head tells me it's time to make a change 
       F        Bb      C                          F
But my heart is telling me "I love you, but you're strange" 

   F                C                 Dm
So one more time at midnight near the wall 
     Gm                             C
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl 
          Am                                       Bb
Won't you come down from the throne from where you sit? 
       F              Bb       C                      F
Let me feel your love one more time, before I abandon it. 

  F                C                     Dm
I come back to the town from the flamin' moon 
  Gm                                C
I see you in the street, I began to swoon 
  Am                               Bb
I love to see you dress before the mirror 
          F      Bb               C                          F
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
