[E]
On the road again
                              [G#7]
Just can't wait to get on the road again
                          [F#m]
The life I love is making music with my friends
   [A]              [B7]                   [E]
And I can't wait to get on the road again


[E]
On the road again
                        [G#7]
Goin' places that I've never been
                          [F#m]
Seein' things that I may never see again
   [A]              [B7]                  [E]
And I can't wait to get on the road again

[A] 
On the road again
                                       [E]
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
[A] 
We're the best of friends
                                       [E]           [B7]
Insisting that the world keep turning our way and our way


[E] 
Is on the road again
                                 [G#7]
I just can't wait to get on the road again
                           [F#m]
The life I love is making music with my friends
   [A]                  [B7]           [E]
And I can't wait to get on the road again
