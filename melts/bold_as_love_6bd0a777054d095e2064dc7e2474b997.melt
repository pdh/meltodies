A       E  
  Anger, he smiles,
           F#                     D
towering in shiny metallic purple armour
      A              E
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
    F#                      D
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
D                        A                Bm
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
     G
They quietly understand
D                    A                  Bm
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
                   G    G#  A
But wonder why the fight is on

            E           F#   G
But they're all bold as love, 
A               E          F#
  Yeah, they're all bold as love
A               E          F#
  Yeah, they're all bold as love
G            A
Just ask the axis

   A         E                        F#
My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
               D
and ribbons of euphoria
A                E
Orange is young, full of daring,
F#                        D
But very unsteady for the first go round
D                 A
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
Bm                             G
In fact I'm trying to say it's frigthened like me
D              A                               Bm
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, 
                             G  G# A
Giving my life to a rainbow like you


       E            F#   G
But im bold bold as love, 
A          E             F#  G
  Yeah, im bold  bold as love
A            E           F#
  Yeah, were all bold as love
G            A
Just ask the axis

yeah yeah yeah....
