YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT COUNTRY
Words and music by Loretta Lynn

[A] Well, I like my lovin' done country style
And [D] this little girl would walk a country mile
To [A] find her a good old slow-talkin' country [E] boy,
I said a country boy [E7]
I'm [A] about as old-fashioned as I can be
And I [D] hope you're likin' what you [A] see
'Cause if you're lookin' at [E] me
You're lookin' at [A] country.

CHORUS
You don't [D] see no city when you look at me
'Cause, [A] country's all I am
I love [D] runnin' bare-footed through the old corn fields
And I [D/F#] love that country [E] ham-ha-ham [E7]
Well, you [A] say I'm made just to fit your plans
But does a [D] barnyard shovel fit your [A] hands
If your eyes are on [E] me
You're lookin' at [A] country.

This here country is a little green
And there's a lot of country that-a you ain't seen
I'll show you around if you'll show me a weddin' band
I said a weddin' band
When it comes to love, well, I know about that
Country folks
If you're lookin' at me
You're lookin' at country.

CHORUS

TAG:  Last line of chorus.
