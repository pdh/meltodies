A pretty cool song that wasn't here when I looked for it and the chords I found online 
weren't very accurate (Not saying these will be 100% either, but I like them better than 
what I found.)

F:  xx3211
Dm: xx0231
A#: x13331

Note: This can also be played with a capo on the 5th fret and by playing the open chords 
of C, Am and F from there (Actually F, Dm and A#, but they look like the open chords 
from the capo).

Intro: F Dm A# F

F                      Dm
When I hear the rain a comin' down
F                      Dm
it makes me sad and blue
F                         Dm
Was on a rainy night like this
A#                        F
that Flo said we were through.


F                   Dm
I told her how I loved her,
F                    Dm
and I begged her not to go
F                           Dm
But another man had changed her mind
A#                   F
so I said goodbye to Flo.


F                     Dm
Alone within my cell tonight
F                      Dm
my heart is filled with fear
F                       Dm
The only sound within the room
A#                      F
is the falling of each tear.


F                          Dm
I think about the thing I've done,
F                    Dm
I know it wasn't right
F                     Dm   A#                          F
They'll bury Flo tomorrow, but they're hanging me tonight,
A#                     F
They're hanging me tonight!


That night he came and took my Flo and headed in to town
I knew I had to find this man and try to gun him down
As I walked by a dim cafe and I looked through the door
I saw my Flo with her new love and I couldn't stand no more,
I couldn't stand no more.

I took my pistol from my hip and with a trembling hand
I took the life of pretty Flo and that good for nothin' man
That good for nothin' man!
I think about the thing I've done I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow, but they're hanging me tonight,
They're hanging me tonight.
