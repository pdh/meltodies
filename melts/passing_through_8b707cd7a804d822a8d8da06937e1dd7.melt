Passing Through (written by R. Blakeslee - ar. L. Cohen)

I've found the words in the lyric archive of ftp.uwp.edu in Dean Engelhards
complete collection of Cohen songs. Here are the chords as closely I could
finger them out. Hope that they are not to wrong .

      C                       F
I saw Jesus on the cross on a hill called Calvary
        C                                 G
"Do you hate mankind for what they done to you?"
         C                                F
He said, "Talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.
        C                   G             C
I've so little time and I'm only passing through."

C
Passing through, passing through.
                           C7
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,
          F
glad that I ran into you.
         C               G               C
Tell the people that you saw me passing through.


      C                             F
I saw Adam leave the Garden with an apple in his hand,
       C                                      G
I said "Now you're out, what are you going to do?"
            C                              F
"Plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.
        C                  G             C
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through."


Passing through, passing through ...

           C                          F
I was with Washington at Valley Ford, shivering in the snow.
         C                                      G
I said, "How come the men here suffer like they do?"
          C                            F
"Men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
      C                       G             C
even though they know they're only passing through"


Passing through, passing through ...

           C                                F
I was with Franklin Roosevelt's side on the night before he died.
         C                                    G
He said, "One world must come out of World War Two" (ah, the fool)
         C                                   F
"Yankee, Russian, white or tan," he said, "A man is still a man.
          C                      G             C
We're all on one road, and we're only passing through."

Passing through, passing through ...

(let's do it one more time)

Passing through, passing through ...


The french songwriter Graeme Allwright sings also this songs. Here are the
french lyrics.


de passage

J'ai vu J?sus sur la croix sur le mont Golgotha
J'ai dit "En veux-tu aux hommes pour ce qu'ils t'ont fait"
Il dit: "Parle d'amour et pas de haine
Pour toute la race humaine
J'ai si peu de temps je suis seulement de passage."

De passage, de passage
Triste, heureux, voyage, dancs ce monde en rage
Dites-leur bien je suis seulement de passage.

J'ai vu Adam quitter le jardin une pomme dans sa main
J'ai dit: "Et maintenant qu'est-ce tu vas faire ?"
"Je travaillerai la terre, et je ferai des pri?res
Je suis orphelin, je suis seulement de passage"

De passage, de passage ..

J'ai suivi Washington at Valley Forge, grelottant de froid
J'ai dit: "Pourquoi les hommes souffrent tant ici?"
"Pour une cause ils peuvent souffrir, sont m?me pr?ts ? mourir
Meme s'ils savent qu'ils sont seulement de passage."

De passage, de passage ..
