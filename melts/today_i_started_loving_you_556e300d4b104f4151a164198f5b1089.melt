Today I Started Loving You Again
                          C             G     D7  G
I'm right back where I've really always been;
                    G7             C                G
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend,
                     D7          G
then Today I Started Loving You Again.
                     C                 G
What a fool I was to think I could get by
                    C                  D7
With only these few million tears I've cried.
  G                     C                G
I should have known the worst was yet to come.
                         D7            G
And that crying time for me had just begun.
         G             C           G     D7  G
'Cause Today I Started Loving You Again,
                          C             G    D7  G
I'm right back where I've really always been;
                    G7             C                G
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend,
                     D7         G       C  G  Am7  G
then Today I Started Loving You Again.
