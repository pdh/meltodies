Subject: Re: Woody (and Bob's) Seven Days



In article &lt;9302191800.AA15317@snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca&gt; you write:

&gt; I am wondering if anyone knows how to play "Seven Days" written by

&gt;Bob Dylan, and recorded by Ronnie Wood way back when for Gimme Some Neck.

&gt;I think Dylan also released it on the Bootleg Series.

&gt;

&gt; It's really a great song, I'd love some pointers on how to play it...

&gt;

&gt;Steve



Hi Steve,

  I love that song too.  I'll try to roughly TAB/TALK you through it.



The opening riff is off the opening E minor chord and goes roughly like

this



E-----2-3-0-2--0---------------

B----------------3--0----------

G------------------------------            repeat for intro

D--2----------------------2--2-

A--2----------------------2--2-

E--0----------------------0--0-



So... The intro is a held out E minor.



Emin       C               G        B                      Emin

Seven more days, she'll be coming.  I'll be waiting at the station

Amin                                B

For her to arrive.  Seven more days all I got to do is survive.



and the other change is



Amin                           Amin

There's kissing in the valley, thieving in the alley

B                          Emin

Fighting every inch of the way.

Amin                         Amin

Trying to be tender with somebody I remember

     B                                                      Emin

In a night that's allways brighter than the day.      Seven Days.





Hope this helps.  All off the top of my head and I haven't played this

one in a couple of years.

   BTW, how's your open tuning playing going?  Check out my sig for a

good riff.

                    -Jim

Here are some chords, the way Wood does it is similiar but not the

same. (anyone have any ideas?)



sevan days 



EM             C                        G

sevan days , sevan long days she'll be comin'

           B7           EM

I'll be waitin' at the station

AM                       

for her to arrive

B7                                      EM

sevan long days, all I gotta do is survive   



She been gone, ever since I been a child, 

ever since I seen her smile

I've never forgotten her eyes



She had a face that outshined the sun and the sky



I've been good, i've been good while i've  been waitin' 

forgive for hesitating, 

but i've been hangin on

sevan more days and all that will be gone



there's kissin' in the alley, theiving in the alley



fightin' every inch of the way



trying to get a lead on, providing the feat on

the nights are always sadder than the days



sevan days , sevan days the wind is knowin'

the whistle will be blowin'

and I know she'll be coming for

my beautifull comrade from the north.



repeat last first.
