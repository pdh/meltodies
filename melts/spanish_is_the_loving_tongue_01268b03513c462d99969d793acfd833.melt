C         Em  F           C
 Spanish is     the loving tongue
C         Em    F         G
  Soft as music, light as spray
C          Em   F              C/G
  It was a girl   I learned it from
C        Em   F     G  C
  Living down   Sonora way

C               Em   F             C/G
  Well, I don't look   much like a lover
C/G       Em   F                G
  Still I hear   her love words over
C        Em   F          C/G
  Mostly when   I'm all alone
F     C/G  G      F/G C
  Mi amor,   mi cora--zon

C        Em    F              C/G
  On the night   that I would ride
C           Em     F        G
  She would listen   for my spurs
C            Em       F      C/G
  Throw that big door   open wide
C/G           Em       G F/G   C
  Raise those laughing eyes of hers

C         Em    F            C/G
  Oh, how night   would go a-flyin’
C        Em    F            G
  All too soon   I hear her sighin’
C        Em    F           C/G
  In her sweet   and quiet tone
F     C/G  G      F/G C
  Mi amor,   mi cora--zon


| C | Em | F   F/G | C |


C           Em  F                C/G
  Haven't seen    her since that night
C         Em    F              G
  I can't cross   the line you know
C              Em  F             C/G
  They want me for   a gamblin' fight
C/G       Em   G         F/G C
  Like as not    it's better so

C         Em     F                   C
  Still I always   kind of missed her
C            Em       F       G
  Since that last sad night I kissed her
C          Em     F            C/G
  Left her heart,   I broke my own
F    C/G  G      F/G C
  Adios,    mi cora--zon
