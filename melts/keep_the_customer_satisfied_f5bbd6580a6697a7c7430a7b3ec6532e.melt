An easier version I did by ear using capo on the 1st fret!

Verse 1
-------
                                D                                           
Gee but its great to be back home
                            D7
Home is where I want to be
                                G
I've been on the road so long my friend
                     D                       G
And if you came along I know you couldn't disagree
                      D   D7
It's the same old story

Chorus
------
D7             G        D          A7
Every where I go, I get slandered, libeled
           D                         G
I hear words I never read in the bible
       D                      Bm
And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
D                                G 
Two steps away from the county line
      D                         G             D
Just trying to keep my customer satisfied, satisfied

-------
                        D              
Deputy sheriff said to me

"Tell me what you come here for, boy
                                G
You better get your bags and flee
                          D                         G
You're in trouble boy and now you're headed into more"
