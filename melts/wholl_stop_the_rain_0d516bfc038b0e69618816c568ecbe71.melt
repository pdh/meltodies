  G                      C                 G
  Long as I remember the rain been comin' down
  G                         C                G
  Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground
  
  C                    G
  Good men through the ages 
  C                  G
  Tryin' to find the sun
  C            D
  And I wonder still I wonder
  Em                      G
  Who'll stop the rain

  G                            C                G
  I went down Virginia seeking shelter from the storm
  G                Bm      C                 G
  Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow  

  C                   G
  Five-year plans and new deals
  C                 G
  Wrapped in golden chains
  C             D
  And I wonder, still I wonder
  Em                      G
  Who'll stop the rain

  Break:

  C-G-D   Am-C-Em   D   G G


  G                          C/G                  G
  Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more
      G                  Bm           C             G
  The crowd had rushed together, just tryin to keep warm

  C                   G
  Still the rain kept pourin'
  C            G
  Fallin on my ears
  C             D
  And I wonder, still I wonder
  Em
  Who'll stop the rain...
