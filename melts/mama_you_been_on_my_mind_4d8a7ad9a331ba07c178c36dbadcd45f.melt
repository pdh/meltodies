A complete take of this song was recorded for Bob Dylan's second 1964 album 
''Another Side Of Bob Dylan'', but for reasons unknown, it was rejected.

Anyway, the best way to play this song is:

Capo on the 5th fret:


Intro | C         | C          | F        F#dim7| C/G
      | C         | C          | F     F#dim7   | C/G G#dim7 Am |


C                                     E7
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
    Am            D7/F#
An' cov'rin' the crossroads I'm standing at
   C                  C/B Am  C/G        Fmaj7
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
    C/G            G6     C
But mama you been on my mind.
 


C                                                      E7
I don't mean trouble please don't put me down or get upset
                 Am   D7/F#
I am not pleadin' or sayin' "I can't forget."
  C                C/B      Am          C/G         Fmaj7
I do not walk the floor bowed down an' bent but yet
 C/G           G6    C
Mama you been on my mind.
 

      C
Even though my mind is hazy an' my thoughts they might be narrow
            E7/B             Am     D7/F#
Where you been don't bother me nor bring me down in sorrow.
    C     C/B   Am               C/B      Fmaj7
It don't even matter to me where you're wakin' up tomorrow
F#dim7 C          G6         C
But mama you're just on my mind.
 


         C                                       E7/B
I am not askin' you to say words like "yes" or "no"
            Am          D7/F#
Please understand me I got no place for you t' go.
          C            C/B Am                  Fmaj7
I'm just breathin' to myself pretendin' not that I don't know
C/G          G6       C
Mama you been on my mind.
 



Instrumental | C  E7  | Am   |  D7/F#         | C/G C/B Am |
             | F  F#dim7    |  C/G   G6   |   C G     | G7 N.C. |


         C
When you wake up in the mornin' baby look inside your mirror.
     E7                               Am    Am/G     D7/F#
You know I won't be next to you you know I won't be near.
          C                             Fmaj7
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
F#dim7  C/G         G7               C  G  G7   C
As someone who has had you on his mind

That's it.
