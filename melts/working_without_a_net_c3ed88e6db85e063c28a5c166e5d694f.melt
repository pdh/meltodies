Verse 1:
          A
	Well the road can be a circus,a death defying act
                                                   E
	But the clowns don't come around no more since the monkeys off my back
            A
	I stand here on the stage,as the house lights fade to black
                               E                         A
	Your love helps me forget,i'm working without a net


Chorus:
          A        D                    A
	Up on the high wire,i hear the crowd begin to call
          D                    E
	Some want you to fly,some want to see you fall
             A
	Now and then i stumble,but i ain't fallen yet
                               E                         A
	Your love helps me forget,i'm working without a net


Verse 2:
          A
	I used to depend on some things i did not need
                                      E
	I leaned on some crutches that kept me off my feet

	Standing here without them now,well it scares me half to death
                               E                         A
	Your love helps me forget,i'm working without a net


Chorus(x2).
