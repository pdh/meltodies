G                                                             D7
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else, nobody's lonesome for me
D7                                                           G
Everybody's thinkin' bout somebody else, nobody thinks about me
         C                           G
When the time rolls around for me to lay down and die,
     C                        A7          D7
I'll probably have to hire me someone to cry
G                                         D7                 G
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else, nobo-dy lonesome for me

G                                                             D7
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else, nobody's lonesome for me
D7                                                            G
Everybody's dreamin' 'bout somebody else, nobody dreams about me
      C                           G
All I need is a bride who wants a big hardy groom
  C                                A7        D7
I wouldn't care if she come ridin' in on a broom
G                                       D7                   G
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else, nobo-dy lonesome for me
