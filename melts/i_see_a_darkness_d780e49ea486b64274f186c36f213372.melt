Intro:

|    Bb   |     F     |    Bb   |     F     |

Dm                            F
       Well, you're my friends.
Bb                       F                Bb
      And can you see?
Dm
       Many times we've been out drinkin',
                                            Bb
Many times we shared our thoughts.
Dm
       But did you ever,
                                                   C  Bb
Ever notice the kind of thoughts I got?
Am                                        Dm                              Bb
      Well, you know I have a love, a love for ev'ry - one I know.
Am                                       Dm                         C   Bb
      And you know I have a drive to live I won't let go.

Dm
      Well, can you see its opposition
            Bb
Comes risin' up sometimes,
        Dm
That it's dreadful imposition
                                     Bb
Comes blacking in my mind,

                          F
And that I see a darkness, 
                          Bb
And that I see a darkness,
                          F
And that I see a darkness,
                          Bb
And that I see a darkness?

                                            F
Did you know how much I love you?
                                             Bb
Here's a hope that somehow you
                                     F                Fsus       F
Can save me from this darkness.

Dm
Well, I hope that someday buddy,
                                        F
We have peace in our lives,

Together or apart,
Dm                                F
     Alone or with our wives,
                                   Dm
And we can stop our whoring
                                      Bb
And pull the smiles in - side
                                F
And light it up for - ever
                             Am
And never go to sleep
                             C
My best unbeaten brother,
                        Am             Bb
This isn't all I seek.

                        F
Oh, no, I see a darkness,
                        Bb
Oh, no, I see a darkness,
                        F
Oh, no, I see a darkness,
                        Bb
Oh, no, I see a darkness,

                                            F
Did you know how much I love you?
                                             Bb
Here's a hope that somehow you
                                     F
Can save me from this darkness.
