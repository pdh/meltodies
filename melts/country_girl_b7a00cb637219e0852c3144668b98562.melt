Country Girl chords
Neil Young (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young)

Capo III

Am D Am D   Am D Am D

Am                             
Winding paths through tables and glass
               Amaj7
First fall was new
Bm           
Now watch the Summer pass
            Cmaj7  Bm  Em
So close to you

A                  
Too late to keep the change
            Cmaj7
Too late to pay
F
No time to stay the same
Esus4        E     
Too young to leave

Am D Am D   Am D Am D

Am          Bm          C           Dm
No pass out sign on the door set me thinking
    Am         Bm         C              G
Are waitresses paying the price of their winking
      Am           G          Am                G
While stars sit at bars and decide what they're drinking
     Am          Bm               C           E
They stop by the die because it's faster than sinking

A                  
Too late to keep the change
            Cmaj7
Too late to pay
F
No time to stay the same
Esus4        E     
Too young to leave

Am D Am D   Am D Am D

Am            Bm          C         Bm
Find out that now was the answer to answers
     C        D
That you gave later
Am          Bm             C          Bm
She did the things that we both did before now
    C      D
But who forgave her?

   Am               D
If I could stand to see her crying
F                Am
I would tell her not to care
                   D
When she learns of all your lying
F                 A   D  A  D
Will she join you there?

A              D
Country girl I think you're pretty
A               D
Got to make you understand
A              D
Have no lovers in the city
A              D         A  D
Let me be your country man
A               D
Got to make you understand
A               D
Got to make you understand
A           D
Country girl ...
