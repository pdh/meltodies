#1.
A#                                   F
You've cut out your dancin', and you never see a show.
F                                           A#
Your friends come by to pick you up and you hardly ever go.
              D#                     A#
It seems your head is in the clouds above.
A#                   F             A#
You've got the ways, of a woman in love.

#2.
A#                                F
I walk by your house at night and hope that I might see..
F                                  A#
the guy who's got you in a spin..I wish that guy was me.
             D#                        A#
I don't know why it's you I'm dreaming of..
A#                   F             A#
You've got the ways, of a woman in love.

CHORUS:
D#                      A#
Many is the night, I've stayed awake and cried.
D#                                     A#              F
Now you'll never know how much, you've hurt my foolish pride.

#3.
A#                        F
I recall your kisses..the times I held you tight.
F                                  A#
Now when I come to see you..you're sitting in the light..
D#                                     A#
Missing all the things that we dreamed of..
A#                   F             A#
You've got the ways, of a woman in love.
