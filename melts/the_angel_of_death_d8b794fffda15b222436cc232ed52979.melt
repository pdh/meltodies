E                               A             E
In the great book of John youre warned of the day
                                     B7
When you'll be laid beneath the cold clay
    E                   A             E
The Angel of Death will come from the sky
                                  B7            E
And claim your poor soul when the time comes to die.



Chorus:
                              A          E
When The Angel of Death comes down after you
                                         B7
Can you smile and say that you have been true
        E                   A          E
Can you truthfully say with your dying breath
                             B7       E
That youre ready to meet the Angel of death.



         E                           A            E
When the lights all grow dim and the dark shadows creep
                                         B7
And then your loved ones are gathered to weep
        E                      A          E
Can you face them and say with your dying breath
                             B7       E
That youre ready to meet the Angel of death.



(Repeat Chorus)
