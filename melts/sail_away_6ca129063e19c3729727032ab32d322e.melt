Intro:
G                              Am

D                              G


Verses:
G                              Am
  I  could  live inside  a  tee-pee
D                              G
   I  could die  in  penthouse  thirty-five
G                              Am
  You could lose me  on the freeway
D                              G
   But I would  still make it back alive


D                              G
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away
D                              C              D
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away               there'll be 
G                              Am                   0-2-3
 wind in  the canyon              moon on the rise
C               D              G      |      |     |     |
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away 


G                              Am
  See the losers  in  the best  bars
D                              G
   Meet  the winners  in  the  dives
G                              Am
  Where the people  are the real stars
D                              G
    All  the  rest  of  their  lives


D                              G
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away
D                              C              D
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away               there'll be 
G                              Am             
 wind in  the canyon              moon on the rise 0-2-3
C               D              G      |      |     |     |
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away 


Solo: (over these chords)
G     Am     D     G     G     Am     D     G


G                              Am
 There's a road stretched between us
D                              G
   Like  a ribbon on  the high plain
G                              Am
  Down from Phoenix through Salinas
D                              G
   Round the bend  and back  again

Chorus:
D                              G
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away
D                              C              D
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away               there'll be 
G                              Am             
 wind in  the canyon              moon on the rise 0-2-3
C               D              G      |      |     |     |
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away 
C               D              G      |      |     |     |
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away 
C               D              G      |      |     |     |
  As  long  as  we  can sail  away
