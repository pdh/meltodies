Album: Ride This Train

CAPO: 3rd / Play: G

INRTO: C G D G

VERSE:
G                        Em                        
My pappy said when I was seventeen
C                            G
You're six feet tall and you face is clean
G                             C        G
And it don't look right for a boy that old
G                    Em
To not make a livin' loading coal


CHORUS:
Em      G       
Loading coal loading coal
G     C                        G
I'm a double-first cousin to a dad-blamed mole
G                     C       G
Never get rich for to save my soul
G                         Em           D       G
And forty-eleven years of loading coal loading coal

VERSE:
G                                    Em
Ain't  never  got  aquainted  with a dollor  bill
C                       G
And I don't ever reckon that I ever will
G                         C          G
A dollar ain't made for a fellow I'm told
G                       Em
That scoops up a livin' loading coal

REPEAT CHORUS

INSTRUMENTAL: G C G D G

VERSE:
G                          Em
I cussed everything in the mining camp
C                                G
From my shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
G                       C           G
But I know just as well when I grow old
G                           Em
I'll still be a cussin' but loading coal

REPEAT CHORUS

INSTRUMENTAL: G C G D G

VERSE:
G                      Em
I know just as well as coal is Black
C                     G
One of these days the mines will strike
G                                C           G
And I'll sit around starving til I'm finally told
G                               Em
There's a nickel more a ton for loading coal


REPEAT CHORUS
G
Loading coal, Loading coal, (fade.....)
