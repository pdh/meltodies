Capo on 5th fret

Intro :   C    Em    Am    G

C
The guilty undertaker sighs
    Em
The lonesome organ grinder cries
    Am                           G
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
    F
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
G
Blow into my face with scorn
         Am
But it's not that way
                 G
I wasn't born to lose you


  C           Em
I want you, I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad,
              C  
Honey, I want you

    C
The drunken politician leaps
 Em
Upon the street where mothers weep
        Am
And the saviors who are fast asleep
    G
They wait for you
      F
And I wait for them to interrupt
    G
Me drinkin' from that broken cup
    Am
And ask me to
            G
Open up the gate for you


  C           Em
I want you, I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad,
              C  
Honey, I want you

    Em
Now all my fathers, they've gone down,
    Am
True love they've been without it
    Em
But all their daughters put me down
       F                 G
'Cause I don't think about it

C
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
    Em
And talk with my chambermaid
    Am
She knows that I'm not afraid
   G
To look at her
F
She is good to me
    G
And there's nothing she doesn't see
    Am
She knows where I'd like to be
    G
But it doesn't matter


  C           Em
I want you, I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad
              C      
Honey, I want you

C
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
   Em
He spoke to me, I took his flute
   Am
No, I wasn't very cute to him
G
Was I?
      F
But I did it, though, because he lied
   G
Because he took you for a ride
    Am
And because tine was on his side
    G
And because I...


  C            Em
I want you,  I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad
              C   
Honey, I want you
