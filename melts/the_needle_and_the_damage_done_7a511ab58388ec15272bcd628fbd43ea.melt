The Needle and The Damage Done chords
Neil Young

D C Cadd9  G Gm Bb  C F Esus4 E  2x

D                           C      Cadd9
I caught you knocking at my cellar door
G                       Gm        Bb
I love you, baby, can I have some more
C    F               Esus4 E
Ooh, ooh, the damage done.

D                    C       Cadd9
I hit the city and I lost my band
G                          Gm     Bb
I watched the needle take another man
C     F                Esus4 E
Gone, gone, the damage done.

D C Cadd9  G Gm Bb  C F Esus4 E  

D                         C        Cadd9
I sing the song because I love the man
G                             Gm   Bb
I know that some of you don t understand
C    F                  Esus4   E
Milk-blood to keep from running out.

D                            C      Cadd9
I ve seen the needle and the damage done
G                      Gm   Bb
A little part of it in everyone
C                        F       Esus4 E
But every junkies like a setting sun.

D C Cadd9  G Gm Bb
