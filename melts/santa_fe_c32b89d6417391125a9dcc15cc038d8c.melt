Santa Fe

D            E7                    A
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe

   D                  A
My woman kneels every day

    D                  A
She promises to let me stay

      D                   A                 E
She's ropin' up a knot to pray to light the way
   
E           
She's in.. 

Santa Fe
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Now she'll open up to let me home
she crys but she needs to roam
She's warpin up a happy home
She thinks every day will be warm in Santa Fe

Santa Fe
Dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Dishonor never needs to roam
And never never far from home
I'll never ever ever roam to sail away

She's all feel bad
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no don't feel bad
She's the worst thing he's ever had
And the mad man, he's so glad
His older brother had it bad
His aunt made me feel so bad I went away

Santa Fe
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My home hearts in L.A.
I won't have a day to wait
And I'm planning every day to run away
&gt;From the Santa Fe

Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My woman's never sittin' at home
She's packin' a valise unknown
She crying like I need been stone
She leavin that under and roam
But she ain't gonna find her room
and the tears send her on her own every day.

A

Right chords, wrong words.
