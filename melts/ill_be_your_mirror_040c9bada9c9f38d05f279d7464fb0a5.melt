               C
I'll be your mirror
                  F                      G
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
              C                       F
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
                   G                         C
The light on your door to show that you're home


                     F        G         C
When you think the night has seen your mind
                      F    G       C
That inside you're twisted and unkind
                  F          G       C
Let me stand to show that you are blind
                       Dm   F
Please put down your hands
              G
'Cause I see you

C - F - C - F - G

I find it hard to believe you don't know
The beauty you are
But if you don't let me be your eyes
A hand in your darkness, so you won't be afraid

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

C             F
I'll be your mirror
(reflect what you are)
