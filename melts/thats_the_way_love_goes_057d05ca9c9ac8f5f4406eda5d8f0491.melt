G                 Dm   G
I've been throwing horseshoes
C            D
Over my left shoulder
C               G 
I've spent most all my life
A                D
Looking for that four-leafed clover
G            Dm   G
When you run with me,
C          D  
Chasing my rainbows
C       G
Honey I love you, too
D                       G
And that's the way love goes.


Chorus:
G                    Dm   G
That's the way love goes, babe
C                D
That's the music God made
C                G 
For all the world to sing
A                  D
It never gets old; it only grows
G               Dm  G
Losing makes me sorry
C               D 
You say, "Honey, don't worry."
C         G
Honey, I love you, too
D                       G
And that's the way love goes.
