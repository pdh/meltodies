Hello, I could not find these chords anywhere so I figured it out with my brother 
teacher) and we came up with this!

By the way this is a song on a Documentary hosted by Johnny Cash called "Ridin' The Rails"

Well if you hear the song, he also plays the bassnotes on the C-acord so its like this;

So when you play a "C" you use the thumb to hit the A-snare, stroke down, than the 
(but your ring finger goes also to the "E") the rest stays a "C" than stroke upwards and than 
again!
(Same story in F, NOT in F/G!!)
HAVE FUN!!! (hope its a bit clear to ya folks!) If you really dont understand it, dont 
to e-mail; Piddie@hotmail.com
It sounds better without a guitar-pick!
