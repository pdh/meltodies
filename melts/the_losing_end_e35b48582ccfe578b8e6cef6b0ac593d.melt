Verse

G
I went into town to see you yesterday
                 D
but you were not home
Am
So I talked to some old friends for a while
                      G
before I wandered off alone

Chorus

G
It's so hard for me now

But I'll make it somehow
         C                      Cm
Though I know I'll never be the same
                           G
Won't you ever change your ways
                          Em
It's so hard to make love pay
                          Am
When you're on the losing end
D                    G
And I feel that way again.

Verse

G
Well, I miss you more than ever since you've gone
              D
I can hardly maintain
Am
Things are different round here every night
                        G
my tears fall down like rain

Repeat Chorus
