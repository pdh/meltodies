Firstly this song is played down a step ie tuned down.
With standard tuning = EADGBE,

Then CITC tuning = DGCFAD (to be in tune with the CD)
So the chords played are Bm &amp; G, not Am &amp; F but tuned down, if you get my drift..

Play Bm with the index finger over the E &amp; B strings, 2nd fret and the thumb over the 
E string, 2nd fret.

This is played, picking the notes while playing the chords.
If you play this in standard tuning it will be a step too high. But tuned down, it will 
in tune with the Freedom version.

     Intro:

     A
     Bm A* Bm   4x
     Bm A* G    2x


                Bm                     Bm  A*   G
     Well, the cop made the showdown
             Bm                  Bm  A*  G
     He was sure he was right
            Bm                  Bm  A*  G
     He had all of the lowdown
               Bm                     Bm  A* G   
  Em
     From the bank heist last night
                                     A  Em
     His best friend was the robber
                                A   Em
     And his wife was a thief
                                     A   Em
     All the children were killers
                                   A   G
     They couldn't get no relief
                                   A   G
     The bungalow was surrounded
                                   A   G
     When a voice loud and clear
                                           A   G
     Said, Come on out with your hands up

     Or we'll blow you out of here.
                                      Bm  A*
     There was a face in the window
               G      Bm   A*
     The TV cameras rolled
                G              Bm    A*
     Then they cut to the announcer
                G              Bm  A*    G      A
     And the story was told.


     Bm  A*   Bm


     The artist looked at the producer
     The producer sat back
     He said what we have got here
     Is a perfect track
     But we don't have a vocal
     And we don't have a song
     If we could get these things accomplished
     Nothin' else could go wrong.
     So he balanced the ashtray
     As he picked up the phone
     And said send me a songwriter
     Who's drifted far from home
     And make sure that he's hungry
     Make sure he's alone
     Send me a cheeseburger
     And a new Rolling Stone.
     Yeah.

     There's still crime in the city,
     Said the cop on the beat,
     I don't know if I can stop it
     I feel like meat on the street
     They paint my car like a target
     I take my orders from fools
     Meanwhile some kid blows my head off
     Well, I play by their rules
     That's why I'm doin' it my way
     I took the law in my hands
     So here I am in the alleyway
     A wad of cash in my pants
     I get paid by a ten year old
     He says he looks up to me
     There's still crime in the city
     But it's good to be free.
     Yeah.

     D    A    G    A

     Now I come from a family
     That has a broken home
     Sometimes I talk to Daddy
     On the telephone
     When he says that he loves me
     I know that he does
     But I wish I could see him
     I wish I knew where he was
     But that's the way all my friends are
     Except maybe one or two
     Wish I could see him this weekend
     Wish I could walk in his shoes
     But now I'm doin' my own thing
     Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad
     Although my home has been broken
     It's the best home I ever had
     Yeah.

      D    A    G    A

     Well, I keep gettin' younger
     My life's been funny that way
     Before I ever learned to talk
     I forgot what to say
     I sassed back to my mom
     I sassed back to my teacher
     I got thrown out of Bible school
     For sassin' back at the preacher
     Then I grew up to be a fireman
     Put out every fire in town
     Put out anything smokin'
     But when I put the hose down
     The judge sent me to prison
     He gave me life without parole
     Wish I never put the hose down
     Wish I never got old.
