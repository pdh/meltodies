Capo I 
 
    G         
Oh, lead me gently home Father 
C              G 
Lead me gently home 
            D         G 
When life's toils are ended 
     C                D 
And parting days have come 
G      
Sin no more will tempt me 
C                    G 
Ne'er from Thee I'll roam 
          D             G 
If you'll only lead me Father 
C        D     G 
Lead me gently home 
 

                  D      C 
Oh lead me gently home, Father 
               D     C 
Lead me gently home, Father 
     D              G 
If I fall upon the wayside 
C        D      G 
Lead me gently home 
 
 
Lead me gently home, Father 
Lead me gently home 
In life's darkest hours, father 
When my troubles come 
Heed my feet from wandering 
Ne'er from Thee I'll roam 
Lest I fall upon the wayside 
Lead me gently home 
 
 
Oh, lead me gently home, Father 
Lead me gently home, Father 
If I fall upon the wayside 
Lead me gently home
