The Rolling Stones

C Em A7 D

G             C            D
Time is on my side, yes it is 
G             C            D
Time is on my side, yes it is 
Em             D
Now you always say 
Em                  A
That you want to be free 
    D           C
But you'll come running back (said you would baby) 
D           C
You'll come running back (I said so many times before) 
D           C               D
You'll come running back to me 

    G             C            D
Oh, time is on my side, yes it is 
G             C            D
Time is on my side, yes it is 
Em                   D
You're searching for good times 
Em                A
But just wait and see 
D           C
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more) 
D           C
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby) 
D           C               D
You'll come running back to me 

C                      G
Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town 
C                            Em
And baby, do everything your heart desires 

Remember, I'll always be around 
C                        
And I know, I know 
                                Em
Like I told you so many times before 

You're gonna come back, baby 

'Cause I know 
A7                     D
You're gonna come back knocking 

Yeah, knocking right on my door 

Yes, yes! 

G             C            D
Time is on my side, yes it is 
G             C            D
Time is on my side, yes it is 
Em               D
'Cause I got the real love 
Em                A
The kind that you need 
D           C
You'll come running back (said you would, baby) 
D           C
You'll come running back (I always said you would)
D           C               D
You'll come running back to me 

    G                         C            D
Yes time, time, time is on my side, yes it is 
G                         C            D
Time, time, time is on my side, yes it is 
    G                         C            D
Oh, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is 
        G                         C            D
I said, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is 
    G                         C
Oh, time, time, time is on my side 
      G                         C
