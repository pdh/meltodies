Bb                                              Eb               Bb
There's a big, brown cloud in the city, And the country side's a sin.
                                                                F
The price of life is too high to give up, It's gotta come down again.
    Bb                Eb       Bb                                Eb
The world wide war is over and done, And the dream of peace come thru.
      Bb                                        F                   Bb
We'll all be drinkin' that free bubble-ubb, And eatin' that Rainbow Stew.

Verse 2:
Bb                                            Eb              Bb
When they find out how to burn water, And the gasoline car is gone.
                                                                     F
When an airplane flies without any fuel, And the satellite heats our home.
Bb                         Eb         Bb                            Eb
One of these days when the air clears up, And the sun comes shinin' thru.
      Bb                                        F                   Bb
We'll all be drinkin' that free bubble-ubb, And eatin' that Rainbow Stew.

Chorus
Bb                                         Eb                Bb
Eatin' Rainbow Stew in a silver spoon underneath that sky of blue.
                                                F                   Bb
We'll all be drinkin' that free bubble-ubb, And eatin' that Rainbow Stew.

Bb                                            Eb                    Bb
You don't have to get high to get happy, Just think about what's in store.
Bb
When people start doin' what they oughta be doin',
                             F
Then they won't be booin' no more.
       Bb                         Eb          Bb                             Eb
When a President goes through the White House doors, Does what he says he'll do.
      Bb                                        F                   Bb
We'll all be drinkin' that free bubble-ubb, And eatin' that Rainbow Stew.
