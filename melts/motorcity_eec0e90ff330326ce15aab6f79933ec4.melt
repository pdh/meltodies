My old car keeps breaking down
My new car ain't from japan
        C                D
There's already too many Datsuns
In this town

Another thing that's bugging me
Is this commercial on t.v.
          C
Says that Detroit can't
     D             G
Make good cars any more

Who's driving my car?

Who's driving my car now?

Whooooo?

My army jeep is still alive
Got locking hubs
And four wheel drive
Ain't got no radio
Ain't got no mag wheels
Ain't got no digital clock
      F   C/E G    (2nd time only)
Ain't got no  clock

The paint job is lookin' blue
The whitewalls are missing too
But I guess until I get my car back
This'll do

Who's driving my car?
Who's driving my car now?
Who?
C             D      G    (hold)
Who's driving my car now?
