B                                                A
Long distance runner, what you standin there for?
B                                 A
Get up, get out,          get out of the door
B                                             A
Your playin cold music on the barroom floor
B                                             A
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.
B                                                    A
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
B                                                    A
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.

B                 A
Fire! fire on the mountain!

B                                  A
Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
B                                      A
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat.
B                                 A
You say it's a livin, we all gotta eat
B                                 A
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete.
B                                A
If mercys a busness, I wish it for you
B                                                A
More than just ashes when your dreams come true.

B                 A
Fire! fire on the mountain!

B                                               A
Long distance runner, what you holdin out for?
B                                         A
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door.
B                                                     A
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
B                                              A
You gave all you had. why you wanna give more?
B                                         A
The more that you give, the more it will take
B                                                    A
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake.

B                 A
Fire! fire on the mountain!
