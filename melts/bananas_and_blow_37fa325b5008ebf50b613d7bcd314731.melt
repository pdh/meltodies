Intro - Em, Em(7th fret), D(Barchord)

Em(7th)                           D
Sancho brought a message from the Fat Man

"Sorry, boy, to leave you high and dry,
but I went to see my mom in Ensenada,
and I left a little something to help the time go by
Just a little something to help to keep you high"

Bananas &amp; Blow (oh - oh), Bananas &amp; Blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on Bananas &amp; Blow

Now the rainy season reminds me of Maria
The way she danced, the color of her hair
Now I'm locked inside a stall at the cantina
Eating the bananas and the cocaine off the mirror
Looking for a ticket to take me away from here

Bananas &amp; Blow (oh - oh), Bananas &amp; Blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on Bananas &amp; Blow

(guitar solo)

Bananas &amp; Blow (oh - oh), Bananas &amp; Blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on Bananas &amp; Blow
