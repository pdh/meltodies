Disappearing between you and me
G               D
A flash from a distant camera

Fragments of our missing dream.

All I want is this song of love,
C    G   D              Em   D   C
Song of love to sing to you
C   G  D            G   D   C
All I need is this song of love,
(no chords)  G   G6   G
To sing for you.


On the floor where daylight dances,
With the ones who missed their chances,
When they couldn't let it show;
Lies the land of sweet surrender,
Like a dream it might have ended there,
But we couldn't let it go.

Now forever we will live as one,
Floating in love's atmosphere;
If love is a piece of dust floating in the sun,
All I want is this song of love,
Song of love to sing to you;
All I need is this song of love,
To sing for you.

(intro chords)
A song of love,
(intro chords)
A song of love.
