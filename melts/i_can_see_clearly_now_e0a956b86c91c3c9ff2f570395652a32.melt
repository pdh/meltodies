E         A               E
I can see clearly now the rain is gone 
          A             B
I can see all obstacles in my way 
E            A                E
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind 
               D        A                 E
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshinin' day 
                D      A                  E
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshinin' day 

Oh yes, I can make it now the pain is gone 
All of the bad feelings have disappeared 
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for 
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshinin' day 

G                                     D
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies 
G                                        B
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies 

I can see clearly now the rain is gone 
I can see all obstacles in my way 
Here's the rainbow I've been praying for 
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshinin' day 
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshinin' day 
Real, real, real, real bright, bright sunshinin' day 
Yeah, hey, it's gonna be a bright, bright sunshinin' day
