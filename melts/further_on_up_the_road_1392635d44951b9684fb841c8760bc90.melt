                    Em                    G
Where the road is dark, and the seed is sowed,
                  Em                       G
Where the gun is cocked, and the bullet's cold,
                     Em   D               Em     D
Where the miles are marked  in blood and gold,
      C               D           Em
I'll meet you further on, up the road,

                      Em                         G
Got on my dead man's suit, and my smilin' skull ring,
                    Em                   G
My lucky graveyard boots, and a song to sing
                 Em   D                         Em     D
I got a song to sing,    to keep me out of the cold
          C               D           Em
And I'll meet you further on, up the road,

                   D                        Em
Further on up the road, further on up the road,
                  Em                    G
Where the way is dark and the night is cold,
           Em    D                Em  D
One sunny mornin'  we'll rise I know,
          C               D           Em
And I'll meet you further on, up the road,

Guitar solo over: Em G x2 Em D x2 C
Em (basically the verse)

                       Em                    G
Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time,
                      Em                  G
Searchin through the dust, lookin' for a sign,
                         D                          Em
If there's a light up ahead, well brother I don't know,
                Em                    B
But I got this fever, burnin' in my soul,
                   Em        D           Em   D
So let's take the good times,   as they go,
          C               D           Em
And I'll meet you further on, up the road,


                   G                        Em
Further on up the road, further on up the road,
                   G                        Em
Further on up the road, further on up the road,
           Em    D                Em  D
One sunny mornin'  we'll rise I know,
          C               D           Em
And I'll meet you further on, up the road,
           Em    D                Em  D
One sunny mornin'  we'll rise I know,
          C               D           Em
And I'll meet you further on, up the road,
