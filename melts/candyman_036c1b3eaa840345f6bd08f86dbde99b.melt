Candyman -- Grateful Dead (Hunter, Garcia)
 
C                                   Gm             F
Come all you pretty women with your hair a hangin' down,
 
F                                             G
Open up your windows 'cause the Candyman's in town.
 
                 Dm      G                   Dm
Come on boys and gamble, roll those laughing bones,
 
F                                             G
Seven come eleven, boys, I'll take your money home.
 
Bb             F        C
Look out, look out, the Candyman,
 
Bb      F             C
Here he come and he's gone again,
 
Am                G
Pretty lady ain't got no friend 'til
 
    F              G
The Candyman comes around again.
 
 
I come in from Memphis where I learned to talk the jive,
When I get back to Memphis, there'll be one less man alive.
Good mornin', Mr. Benson, I see you're doing well,
If I had me a shotgun, I'd blow you straight to hell.
 
Come on boys and wager if you have got the mind,
If you've got a dollar, boys, then lay it on the line.
Hand me my old guitar, pass the whiskey 'round,
Won't you tell everybody you meet that the Candyman's in town.
