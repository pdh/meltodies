(Verse 1)
D              F#           Bm               E
Love’s always lovely, when first two lovers meet.
D              A          E                 A
Hand in hand, arm in arm, walkin’ down the street.
D              F#         Bm             E
Always seen together, in everything they do.
D                A               D – G – D
Love is always pretty, when it’s new.

(Verse 2)
D               F#        Bm               E
Love is always special, especially to the heart.
D                             A
When it’s love on sight, and all is right, and there’s
E                  A
No doubt from the start.
D                    F#                  Bm             E
Before it starts to crumble, there’ll be many shades of blue.
D                       A                D – G – D
Ah, but love is always pretty when it’s new.

(Chorus)
D               F#               Bm        E
Love is always pretty, when it’s new.
               D          A                   E
Hey, there’s nothing bad about it, ‘til your lover says, “We’re 
A
through.”
D                F#                Bm              E
Old love’s even sweeter, that old saying’s really true.
D                A              D – G – D
Love is always pretty when it’s new.
