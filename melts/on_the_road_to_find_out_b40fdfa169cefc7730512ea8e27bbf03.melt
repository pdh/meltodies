Cat Stevens 

         G      C     G                C            G   
Well, I left my happy home to see what I could find out,

G D7 G  G D7 G

  G       C       G                       C             G 
I left my folk, &amp; friends with the aim to clear my mind out!

G D7 G  G D7 G

        C       F     C           F       C        
Well, I hit the rowdy road,&amp; many kinds I met there,
C    F       C       Am     D7     G   D7  G   G   D7  G
Many stories told me of the way to get there!  Oo,oo, oo

   C       F    C               F        C   
So on, and on I go, the seconds tick the time out,
        C       F       C             Am     D7      G    D7 G
There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out!  
G  D7 G
Oo,oo,oo

G    G4   G    G    G4      G
Naa, naa, naa! Naa, naa, na-nan, naa! 
G      C        G         G      C     G 
In the end I'll know, but on the way I won-der,  

G    D7   G    G    D7      G
Naa, naa, naa! Naa, naa, na-nan, naa!

G           C       G                   C       G
Through des-cending snow, &amp; through the frost &amp; thun-der!

G    D7   G     G     D7      G
Naa, naa, naa!  Naa,  naa, na-nan, naa!

        C             F         C    
Well, I listen to the wind come howl,  
C            F       C    
Telling me I have to hurry,
  C             F       C     Am     D7     G   D7  G
I listen to the robin's song, saying not to worry!

G  D7  G
Oo,oo,oo!

   C       F    C               F             C   
So on, and on I go, the seconds tick the time out,
        C       F       C             Am     D7      G    D7  G
There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out!
  
G  D7  G
Oo,oo,oo!

G    D7   G    G    D7      G
Naa, naa, naa! Naa, naa, na-nan, naa!
G    D7   G    G    D7      G
Naa, naa, naa! Naa, naa, na-nan, naa!

       G     C       G              C             G      
Then I found my-self a-lone, hoping someone would miss me!
G    D7   G     G     D7      G
Naa, naa, naa!  Naa,  naa, na-nan, naa!

G        C         G                  C        G
Thinking a-bout my home, and the last woman to kiss me,...      
G    D7   G    G    D7      G
Naa, naa, naa! Naa, naa, na-nan, naa!

... kiss me!
      C             F       C    
Well, sometimes you have to moan,     
     C       F        C     
When nothing seems to suit ya,
     C        F         C  
But, neverthe-less, you know, 
        Am    D7           G   D7  G
You're locked to-wards the future!
   
G  D7  G
Oo,oo,oo!

   C       F    C       C       F             C   
So on, and on I go, the seconds tick the time out,
        C       F       C             Am     D7      G    D7 G
There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out!  
G  D7  G
Oo,oo,oo!

       G        C        G                  C    G
Then I found my head one day, when I wasn't even try-ing,
G    D7   G    G    D7      G
Naa, naa, naa! Naa, naa, na-nan, naa!
 
    G      C       G                       C      G
And here I have to say, 'cause there is no use in ly-ing,
G    D7   G     G     D7      G
Naa, naa, naa!  Naa,  naa, na-nan, naa! ... ly-ing!         

         C      F         C   
Yes, the answer lies with-in,   
   C       F           C   
So why not take a look now? 
C            F     C         
Kick out the devil sin,

Am                    D7   G    D7 G    G   D7  G
Pick up,... pick up a good book now---! Oo-oo,oo!

         C      F         C   
Yes, the answer lies with-in,     
   C       F           C   
So why not take a look now? 
C            F     C         
Kick out the devil sin,
     Am               D7        G   D7 G  G   D7  G
Pick up,... pick up a good book now---!   Oo-oo,oo---!

         C      F         C   
Yes, the answer lies with-in,     

   C       F           C   
So why not take a look now? 
C            F     C         
Kick out the devil sin,
     Am               D7        G   D7 G  G   D7  G
Pick up,... pick up a good book now---!   Oo-oo,oo---!

G    D7   G    G    D7      G
Naa, naa, naa! Naa, naa, na-nan, naa!

Naa, naa, naa! Naa, naa, na-nan, naa!
