Subject: CRD: Blowin' in the Wind

The chord files available on the web for this song that I have seen
are not quite accurate. There is a little descending melody line played 
primarily on the D string that echoes the vocal. To get this it has to be 
played capoed at the 2nd fret, as is the recorded version on "Frewheelin'".

Just listen to the record to get the alternate bass picking right.
Another deceptively simple, but incredibly powerful Dylan song.

Blowin' In the Wind
Bob Dylan

Tuning: Standard (EADGBe)
Capo: 2nd fret

Chords: (relative to 2nd fret)

C: x30210
F: x32211
G: 320003

C        F            G        C               F          C
How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man?

C        F           G          C                   F            G
How many seas must a white dove sail before she can sleep in the sand?

C        F              G            C                   F       C
How many times must the cannon balls fly before they are forever banned?

C   F         G          C              F   
The answer my friend, is blowin' in the wind.

              G              C
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many years can a mountain exist Before it's washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist Before they're allowed to be free? 
How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see? 
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, 
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many times must a man look up Before he can see the sky? 
How many ears must one man have Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows That too many people have died? 
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, 
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
