Emotionally Yours						Bob Dylan


Intro:  C   C/B   Am   F     /     C   C/B    F     F
 

C          C/B    Am             F      C          C/B        F       F
Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun.
C          C/B    Am             F      C          C/B        F       F
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Am         F        C                     F       C        G      G11     G
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors.
    C     C/B    Am   F C   G11    C                  C
But I will always be emotionally yours.

Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart.
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start.
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for.
And I will always be emotionally yours.

Fmaj7           Fmaj7                 C             C
It's like my whole life never happened,
Fmaj7           Fmaj7                         C             C
When I see you, it's as if I never had a thought.
E7             E7                Am          Am
I know this dream, it might be crazy,
D7          D7             G11              G
But it's the only one I've got.

Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied.
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
