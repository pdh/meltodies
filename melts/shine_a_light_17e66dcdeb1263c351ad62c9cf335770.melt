 C                        G
 Saw you stretched out in Room Ten O Nine
        Am                       G
 With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
 F                     C          G    F               C   G
 Couldn't see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love
 
 Berber jew'lry jangling down the street
 Make you shut your eyes at ev'ry woman that you meet
 Could not seem to get a high on you, my sweet honey love
 
 chorus

  C                         G
  May the good Lord shine a light on you
  Am         F            C              G
  Make every song you sing your favorite tune
  May the good Lord shine a light on you
  Warm like the evening sun
 
 
 Well, you're in the alley, baby, with your clothes all torn
 And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
 Just seemed too many flies on you, I can't brush them off
 Angels beating all their wings in time
 With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes
 Thought I heard on sigh for you
 Come on up, come on up, now, come on up now
 
  chorus
