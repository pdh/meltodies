BURNED

G7(sus4) 

G7    C                               C       F
Been burned and with both feet on the ground,

       C              F                   G7  G7(sus4)
I've learned that it's painful comin' down.

C                 Em             Dm                    F
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay;

C               E+             Am
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',

C        E+           Fmaj7
no time left and I know I'm losin'.


  C           F                  C
Flashed and I think I'm fallin' down,

                F                                  
(Flashed and I think I'm falling down.)

  C             F                     G7  G7(sus4)
Crashed, and my ears can't hear a sound.          (The sound.)

C                 Em             Dm                   F
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay;

C               E+             Am
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',

C        E+           Fmaj7
no time left and I know I'm losin'.


C               E+             Am
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',

C        E+           Fmaj7
no time left and I know I'm losin'.

 C             F                 C       F
Burned and with both feet on the ground.

  C             F                 C       F            
(Burned and with both feet on the ground.)

       C               F                 G7  G7(sus4)
I've learned that it's painful comin' down.

C                 Em             Dm                   F
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay;

C               E+             Am
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',

C        E+           Fmaj7
no time left and I know I'm losin'.
