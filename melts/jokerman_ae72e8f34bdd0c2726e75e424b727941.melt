The best way to play this song is as follows:

Capo on the first fret:


A                         Amaj7
Standing on the water, casting your bread
           Bm/A                    E/A             A
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
A                      Amaj7
Distant ships sailing into the mist
          Bm/A                              E/A                        A
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was 
blowing
Bm       E                          A
Freedom just around the corner for you
          Bm               E                  A   D
But with truth so far off, what good will it do.



E                          D
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
A         E/G#        F#m          D
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
C#m7  D6  E   A
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.



A                    Amaj7
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
Bm/A             E/A                  A  D/A
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
A                    Amaj7
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Bm/A                       E/A                     A
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
Bm            E                 A
Shedding off one more layer of skin
         Bm            E                     A    D
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.




E                      D
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
A         E/G#        F#m          D
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
C#m7  D6  E   A
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.





         A                              Anaj7
You're a man of the mountain, you can walk on the clouds
      Bm/A                      E/A            A  D/A
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
                 A
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
     Amaj7                     Bm/A              E/A           A
But what do you care ? Ain't nobody there would want marry your sister
Bm                       E                     A
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
                 Bm                E                         A        D
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.



E                         D
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
A          E/G#        F#m         D
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
C#m7  D6  E   A
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.







          A                      Amaj7
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
     Bm/A                      E/A               A    D/A
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
       A                           Amaj7
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Bm/A         E/A                               A
Michelangeo indeed could've carved out your features
Bm                      E                     A
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
          Bm                      E                       A    D
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.




E                       D
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
A          E/G#        F#m         D
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
C#m7 D6  E    A
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.



           A                        Ammaj7 
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
        Bm/A                        E/A                  A        D/A
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain 
A                               Amaj7 
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
       Bm/A           E/A                  A
Molotow cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
Bm                    E                          A
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
       Bm               E                            A  D
Only a matter of time 'til the night comes stepping in.






E                      D
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
A          E/G#        F#m         D
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
C#m7  D6  E   A
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.





        A                         Amaj7
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray
   Bm/A                      E/A                              A      D/A
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
                A                            Amaj7
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
           Bm/A                       E/A
Take the motherless children off the street
                        A
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Bm             E                 A
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Bm             E                     A    D
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.





E                       D
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
A          E/G#      F#m          D

C#m7 D6  E    A
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
