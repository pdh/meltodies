One Cup of Coffee by Bob Marley
Transcribed by John Stewart

Intro:  D#, A#7,D#

 D#
              A#7
One cup of Coffee then I go, though I just dropped by to let you know
             D#                D#7            G#
That I'm leaving you tommorrow, I cause you no more sorrow
D#             A#7             D#
One cup of coffee then I go

I brought the money, like my lawyer said to do
But it won't replace the heartache that I've caused you
It won't take the place of loving you, I know
So One cup of coffee then I go

G#                                              D#
Tell the kids I came last night and kissed them while they slept
G#                                              A#7
Make my coffee sweet and warm, just the way you used to light my heart

I brought the money.......(repeat verse and fade)


"Excuse me while I light my splif"
