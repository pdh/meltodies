       A                               D               
I said Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shining
  A                      E        A           
 Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
 A                               D               
 Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shining
 A                        E        A          
 Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
 D                             A                   
 It was on one moonlight night Stars shining bright
 D                A              E            
 Whisper on high, Your love said goodbye
 A                             D                   
 Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
 A                       E             A                
 Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
