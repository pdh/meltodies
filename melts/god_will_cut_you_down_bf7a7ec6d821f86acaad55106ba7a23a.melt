Tell the rambiler, the gambler, the back biter,

Well my goodness gracious, 
E
Let me tell you the news. 
E
My heads been wet with the midnight dew.
E
I've been down on bended knee, 
E
Talkin to the man from Galiee. 
E
He spoke to me in a voice so sweet,
E
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels feet.
E
He called my name and my heart stood still,
E
When He said "John go do my will"
                                                  
E
Go and tell that long tongue liar,

E
You can throw your rock, hide your hand, 
E
Workin in the dark against your fellow man. 
E
But as sure as God made black and white, 
E                  
What's done in the dark, 
        D              E
Will be brought to the light.
