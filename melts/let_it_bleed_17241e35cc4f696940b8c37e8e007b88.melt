     Let It Bleed

     ------------



 Intro: C-Csus4-C-Csus4-C-F-Fsus4-F-G



     C                          F

     We all need someone we can lean on

                G                        C

     And if you want to, you can lean on me

                                F

     We all need someone we can lean on

                G                        C

     And if you want to, you can lean on me





     C                                          F

     She said my breasts, they will always be open

     G                                     C

     You can rest your weary head right on me

                                                    F

     And there will always be a space in my parking lot

     G                               C

     When you need a little coke and sympathy





     C                          F

     We all need someone we can cream on

                G                         C

     And if you want to, you can cream on me

                                F

     We all need someone we can dream on

                G                         C

     And if you want to, you can dream on me





     C                                          F

     I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement

     G                                                 C

     Thats when she took my health and sent it Jasmine Tea

                                                   F

     And then she knifed me in my dirty filthy basement

     G                             C

     With that jaded, faded, junky nurse  (Oh what pleasant company)





     C                          F

     We all need someone we can bleed on

                G                         C

     And if you want to, you can bleed on me

                                F

     We all need someone we can bleed on

                G                         C

     And if you want to, you can bleed on me





     C             F             G

     Take my arms, take my legs, oh baby don't you take my head

     C              F              G                                     C

     Bleed alright, bleed alright, bleed alright, you can bleed all over me

     C              F              G                                         C

     Bleed alright, bleed alright, you can be my rider, you can cum all over me

I think ther's an E chord in there:



&gt;

&gt;     C           -&gt; E  F

&gt;     She said my breasts, they will always be open

&gt;     G                                     C

&gt;     You can rest your weary head right on me

&gt;                    E                               F

&gt;     And there will always be a space in my parking lot

&gt;     G                               C

&gt;     When you need a little coke and sympathy
