C
The guilty undertaker sighs,
    Em
The lonesome organ grinder cries,
    Am                           G
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
    F
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
G*
Blow into my face with scorn,
         Em
But it's not that way,
                 G
I wasn't born to lose you.


  C           Em
I want you, I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad,
              C  Em Am G
Honey, I want you.

    C
The drunken politician leaps
 Em
Upon the street where mothers weep
        Am
And the saviors who are fast asleep,
    G
They wait for you.
      F
And I wait for them to interrupt
G*
Me drinkin' from that broken cup
    Em
And ask me to
            G
Open up the gate for you.


  C           Em
I want you, I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad,
              C  Em Am G
Honey, I want you.

    Em
Now all my fathers, they've gone down,
Am
True love they've been without it.
    Em
But all their daughters put me down
       F                 G
'Cause I don't think about it.

C
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
    Em
And talk with my chambermaid.
Am
She knows that I'm not afraid
   G
To look at her
F
She is good to me
G*
And there's nothing she doesn't see.
    Em
She knows where I'd like to be
G
But it doesn't matter.


  C          Em
I want you, I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad
         C      Em Am G
Honey, I want you.

C
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
   Em
He spoke to me, I took his flute.
Am
No, I wasn't very cute to him,
G
Was I?
      F
But I did it, though, because he lied
G*
Because he took you for a ride
    Em
And because tine was on his side
    G
And because I...


  C            Em
I want you,  I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad
         C     Em Am G
Honey, I want you.
