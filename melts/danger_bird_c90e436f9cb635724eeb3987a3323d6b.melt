Here are the chords for Danger Bird by Neil Young.

Intro
F    G    A
 

F      G           A
Danger bird  flies alone 
F            G                A
He rides the wind back to his home
F            G                    A
Although his wings have turned to stone
Em             D     C
And he used to be so calm
C     Em              D       C
Now I think about you all day long..
C        Em      D      C
Here you are and here I am....

Repeat same chord pattern for the rest of the song.
