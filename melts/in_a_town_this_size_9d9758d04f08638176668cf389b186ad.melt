In a town this size (Key of D)
John Prine &amp; Delores Keane (Irish singer of all people - she sounded Cajun in this!)
The intro is kind of cool pickin.  The chords and singing are a great wind down from a
of drinkin and smokin.  I'm trying to figure it out, likely if I do I'll never get to
it.  If ANYONE out there has it !PLEASE! post it and save me some trouble.  I think it's 
key of D cause his picking is in the D scale (minor) I believe.


Intro and solo revolves around open D chord with the D minor scale around it (unless I'm
in La la land here).
