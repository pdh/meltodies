G           G    F
  Watch out        you might get what you're after
G      G  G     F
  Cool babies     strange but not a stranger
G              G  F           G
           I'm an ord-in-ar-y guy
A7               F
Burning down the house



G             G    F
  Hold tight         wait till the party's over
G        G   G    F
  Hold tight        We're in for nasty weather
G              G    F          G
     There has got  to  be  a  way
A7               F
Burning down the house

Here's your ticket pack your bag: time for jumpin' overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, Maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire

G         G   F
  All wet       hey you might need a raincoat
G      G  G  F
  Shakedown    dreams walking in broad daylight
G         G    F              G
Three hun-dred six-ty five de-grees
A7               F
Burning down the house

It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work baby what did you except
Gonna burst into flame

(weird music)
A7               F
Burning down the house


G          G   F
  My house       S'out of the ordinary
G        G  G    F
  That's might     Don't want to hurt nobody
G                G    F              G
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
A7               F
Burning down the house

No visible means of support and you have not seen nuthin' yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect starring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire
