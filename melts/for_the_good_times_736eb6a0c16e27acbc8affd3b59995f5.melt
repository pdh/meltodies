Johnny Cash â€“ For the Good Times


Intro: C


              Dm  G           C
Don't look so sad, I know it's over

              Dm               G                  C
But life goes on, and this old World will keep on turning

               F               G              C
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together

           Dm                                  G
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning


         C            G
Lay your head upon my pillow

                                        C
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine

           C             C7               F                Fm
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window 

    Dm                               G
And make believe you love me one more time

        C
For the good times


            Dm G             C
I'll get along, you'll find another

            Dm               G               C            
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me

            F            G           C
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever

            Dm                               G
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me


          C            G
Lay your head upon my pillow

                                         C
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine

            C           C7                F                Fm
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window 

      Dm                              G
And make believe you love me one more time

         C
For the good times
