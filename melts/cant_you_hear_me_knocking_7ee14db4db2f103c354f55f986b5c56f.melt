Bringing a page of tab to a jam session for this is a little much, so
for folks who can work out the guitar leads and solos and stuff
on their own, here's the general layout of the chords as I hear it.

Guitar lick based on chords F-E-D-E-F-E-D-D-B-D
(start with playing middle notes of the F chord barred on the 8th fret, 
and slide between the chords quickly to get the idea.  Whittle it down
from there :)

C        D
   Yeah, you got satin shoes

C        G       D
   Yeah, you got plastic boots

C        D
   Y'all got cocaine eyes

C        G       D
   Yeah, you got speed-freak jive 

C                 D
Can't you hear me knockin' on your window

C                 G        D
Can't you hear me knockin' on your door

C                 D                                      C
Can't you hear me knockin' down your dirty street, yeah 

G       F     C        G
Help me baby, ain't no stranger
Help me baby, ain't no stranger 
Help me baby, ain't no stranger 

C                           D
Can't you hear me knockin', ahh, are you safe asleep?

C                           G              D
Can't you hear me knockin', yeah, down the gas light street, now 

C                           D                             C
Can't you hear me knockin', yeah, throw me down the keys 
Alright now 

G       F       C        G        
Hear me ringing big bell tolls 
Hear me singing soft and low 
I've been begging on my knees 
I've been kickin', help me please

G       F         C         G 
Hear me prowlin', I'm gonna take you down 
Hear me growlin', Yeah, I've got flatted feet now, now, now, now 
Hear me howlin', And all, all around your street now 
Hear me knockin', And all, all around your town
