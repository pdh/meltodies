There's Somebody Else On Your Mind

C                      Em           C
There’s laughter and a band playing loud
    F
But you don’t fit in with the crowd
           C         Em         A
And you’re only with me killing time
        Dm       G            C 
There's somebody else on your mind

We’re dancing and you’re holding me tight
But the words to the song isn’t right
They’re singing ‘bout old lonesome time
There's somebody else on your mind

F
There's somebody else I wish I could be
              C                                A
Cause there's somebody else you want more than me
           C         Em         A
And you’re only with me killing time
        Dm       G            C
There's somebody else on your mind
