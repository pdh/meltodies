           C                                                    G
      John Henry when he was a baby,sittin down on his mammy's knee.
               C                         F
             Picked up a hammer in his little right hand. 
                        G                     C
              He said that'll be the death of me.me,me.
                     G     G6   G7                C
               That hammer gonna be the death of me.

                      

            Woody acented the C with an open shut run
         On the forth string second fret but its optional.
  

               Sorry for not having all the lyrics 
              but the song is the same throughout
