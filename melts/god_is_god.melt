G
I believe in prophecy.
G                     C                    G
Some folks see things not everybody can see.
G                        D7                      G
And,once in a while,they pass the secret along to you and me.
G
And I believe in miracles.
G                C                            G
Something sacred burning in every bush and tree.
G                   D7                            G
We can all learn to sing the songs the angels sing.

Chorus:
C       D          E        C          G
Yeah, I believe in God, and God ain&amp;#146;t me.
                                               
G
I&amp;#146;ve traveled around the world, 
G                          C                             G
Stood on mighty mountains and gazed across the wilderness.
G                       D7                           G
Never seen a line in the sand or a diamond in the dust.

G
And as our fate unfurls,
G                     C                             G
Every day that passes I&amp;#146;m sure about a little bit less.
G             D7                                     G
Even my money keeps telling me it&amp;#146;s God I need to trust.

Chorus:
C       D          E      C          G
And I believe in God, but God ain&amp;#146;t us.
