DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT- The Talking Heads

 C                            A
I see the clouds that move across the sky
 C                             A
I see the wind that moves the clouds away
 G                  F/G           Am
It moves the clouds over by the building
 G                        F/G       Am
I pick the building that I want to live in
  C                              A
I smell the pine tress and the beeches in the woods
  C                        A
I see the pine cones that fall by the highway
  G                      F/G          Am
That's the highway that goes to the building
   G                     F/G          Am
I pick the building that I want to live in

CHORUS:
      C                Dm7  G/A
It's over there, it's over there
 D                G        D
My building has every convenience
 D                    G       D
It's gonna make life easy for me
 D                     G          D
It's gonna be easy to get things done
 D              G            D
I will relax along with my loved ones
 E                      Dmaj7      Bm7
Loved ones, loved ones, visit the building
           E                 Dmaj7      Bm7
Take the highway, park and come up and see me
           E                  Dmaj7        Bm7
I'll be working, working, but if you come visit
           E                      Dmaj7         Bm7
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important
  Dm7     G/A        D   Dm7        G/A        D
Don't ya worry 'bout me, I wouldn't worry about me
  Dm7     G/A        D    Dm7       G/A         D
Don't ya worry 'bout me, I wouldn't worry about me


I see the states across this big nation
I see the laws made in Washington, D.C.
I think of the ones I consider my favorites
I think of the people that are working for me
Some civil servants are just like my loved ones
They work so hard and they try to be strong
I'm a lucky guy to live in my building
They all need buildings to help them along
CHORUS

Dm7: x x 0 2 1 1  Dmaj7: x x 0 2 2 2   G/A: 3 0 0 0 0 3
Bm7: 2 2 4 2 3 2
