SO LONG MARIANNE  
Leonard Cohen

[Verse 1]
     A                               Bm       
Come over to the window,  my little darling
D                              A
I'd like to try to read your palm
G                                    D
I used to think I was some sort of gypsy boy
F#m                         E   Esus4 E E7 
   before I let you take me home

[Chorus]
    A                 F#m
Now so long, Marianne,    It's time that we began
    E   Esus4     E  E7     E Esus4       E      E7     A        Asus4      
to laugh      and cry   and cry      and laugh about it all again

[Verse 2]
          A                  Bm   
Well you know that I love to live with you
D                                A
 but you make me forget so very much
G                          D
 I forget to pray for the angels
             F#m                       E  sus4 E E7 
and then the angels forget to pray for us

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
    A               Bm  
We met when we were almost young 
D                         A 
 deep in the green lilac park
G                                D
 You held on to me like I was a crucifix
F#m                                 E   Esus4 E E7 
   as we went kneeling through the dark

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
      A                                 Bm
Your letters they all say that you're beside me now
D                        A
 then why do I feel so alone
G                                 D 
 I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
    F#m                      E  Esus4 E E7
is fastening my ankle to a stone

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
     A              Bm
For now I need your hidden love
D                         A
 I'm cold as a new razor blade
G                                D
 You left when I told you I was curious
F#m                         E   Esus4 E E7
   I never said that I was brave

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
     A                     Bm
Oh, you are really such a pretty one
D                                   A 
 I see you've gone and changed your name again
G                              D
 And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
    F#m                     E  Esus4 E E7
to wash my eyelids in the rain

[Chorus]

[I found this extra verse written out somewhere. Not on the original recording from the Best Of... Disc]

   A                    Bm
Oh, your eyes, well, I forget your eyes
D                              A
 your body's at home in every sea
G                             D
 How come you gave away your news to everyone
F#m                              E Esus4 E E7
   that you said was a secret to me
