[Intro]

F Dm F Dm C

[Verse 1]

F                                        Dm
You came down to this southern town last summer
   Gm                                C
To show the folks a brand new way of life
    F                                         Dm
But all you've shown the folks around here is trouble
           G                          C
And you've only added misery to their strife
C7                              F 
Your concern is not to help the people
         F7                                Bb
And I'll say again, though it's been often said
                C                F           Dm
Your concern is just to bring discomfort, my friend
         Gm                      C         
And your policy is just a little red
             Dm
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
C 
  (ain't he right)

[Verse 2]

   F                             Dm
It matters not to you how people suffer
    Gm                                 C
And should they, you'd consider that a gain
    F                             Dm 
You bring a lot of trouble to the town and then you leave
G                               C
That's part of your Communistic game
C7                     F  
I detect a little Communism
F7                             Bb
I can see it in the things you do
            C         F                Dm
Communisim, socialism call it what you like
        Gm                            C
There's very little difference in the two
             Dm                    
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
C   
  (ain't he right)

[Verse 3]

     F                               Dm
Your followers sometimes have been a bearded, hatless bunch
        Gm                      C
There's even been a minister or two
  F                             Dm
A priest, a nun, a rabbi and an educated man
     G                             C
Have listened and been taken in by you
        C7                               F
Aw, the country's full of two-faced politicians
F7                                        Bb
Who encourage you with words that go like this
                     C                 F          Dm
Burn your draft card if you like, it's good to disagree
         Gm                        C
That's a get acquainted Communistic kiss
             Dm                   
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
C
  (ain't he right)

[Verse 4]

    F                           Dm 
One politician said it would be nice to send some blood
    Gm                    C
And help the enemy in Vietnam
       F                    
That's what he says, here's what I say
Dm                  
Let's just keep the blood
G                                  C
Instead let's send that politician man
      C7                          F        
Let's rid the country of the politicians,
    F7                                    Bb
Who call us tramps, that march out in our streets
                     C               F           Dm
Protesting those who wanna fight for freedom, my friend
     Gm                               C
This kind of leader makes our country weak
             Dm                    
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
C
  (ain't he right)

[Verse 5]

      F                                 Dm
Let's look and find the strong and able leaders
     Gm                                    C
It's time we found just how our neighbours stand
   F                                Dm
If we're to win this war with Communism
      G                            C
Let's fight it here as well as Vietnam
      C7                       F
Let's rise as one and meet our obligations
   F7                           Bb
So Communistic boots will never trod
                     C                 F        Dm
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
         Gm              C              F
With the blessing of our great almighty God
 Bb                  C                F         Dm
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
         Gm                      Bb  C  F
With the blessing of our great almighty God
