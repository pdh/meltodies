Bridge

     E
for there is nowhere i can run
B                E
and there is no hiding place.

stickin out like a sore thumb
B               E            D
by that gloomy look upon my face.



verse 3

without love, i'm incomplete.
without love, i am not whole.
without love, i'm barely on my feet.
i am dyin without love.

bridge

for there is nowhere i can run
and there is no hiding place.
stickin out like a sore thumb
by that gloomy look upon my face.

verse 4

without love, i'm incomplete.
without love, i am not whole.
without love, i'm barley on my feet.
i am dyin without love.
i am dyin without love.
