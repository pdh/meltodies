       D                               A
I said Oh no ! Don't cha bother me no more
       D                                A
I said Oh no ! Don't cha bother me no more
       E7                          D               A
Well I'm looking for my face and I got no place to go


         D                               A
I said Oh no ! Don't cha bother me no more
          D                              A
I said Oh no ! Don't cha bother me no more
       E7                     D                  A
Well pick your own mine and don't touch mine no more


          E7
Well I'm still waiting here for a single idea

In your clothes and your hair , I wore it last year
   D7                            A
Oh no ! Don't cha bother me no more


SOLO :  D / A / D / A / E7 / A /

         D                              A
I said Oh no ! Don't cha bother me no more
         D                            A
I said Oh no ! Don't cha copy me no more
          E7                       D                         A
Well the lines a down my eyes are protected by a copyright law


           E7
All the clubs and the bars and the little red cars
                                        D
Not knowing why but trying to get high no,
                         A
 Don't cha bother me no more

 Don't cha bother

 Don't cha bother
