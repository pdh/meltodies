 though so apart we've grown.

Verse 2:
A                  F#m        Dsus2
 And I'm goin' to thank that old country fiddler
A               F#m            Dsus2
 And all those rough boys who play that rock and roll
A         F#m      Dsus2
 I never tried to burn any bridges
A          F#m            Dsus2
 Though I know I let some good things go.

 From down in L.A., all the way to Nashville
A          F#m        Dsus2
 New York City, to my Canadian prarie home.
A                F#m         Dsus2
 My friends are scattered like leafs from an old maple
A          F#m  Dsus2 
 Some are weak and some are strong.
