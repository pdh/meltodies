                       ALL THE WAY DOWN
                        ROLLING STONES


INTRO:   *"ROLL" BARRED E CHORD -- 4x's    *"ROLL MEANS TO BARRE
                                             THE E CHORD AND WHILE
VERSE:                                       HOLDING DOWN THE STRINGS
      E                                      ON THE 5th FRET, LIFT
      I was twenty one naive                 UP AND DOWN THE STRINGS
                                   B         ON THE 7th FRET.
      Not cynical, I try to please
       E
      Her wit, her speech, her repartee
                                    B
      Impressed me almost instantly


CHORUS:
                A
      She went all the way
                    B
      All the way down
                A
      She went all the way, all the way


VERSE:
      E
      She showed me sex a hundred ways
                                       B
      And how she pimped and how she paid
           E
      And all the daughters, all the sons
                                      B
      All were welcome, all would come


CHORUS:
      We went all the way
      All the way down
      We went all the way, all the way

VERSE:
      I was King, Mr. Cool
      Just a snobby little fool
      (Like kids are now)
      I dreamed of reaching greater heights
      I raved about it every night
      Talk is cheap

CHORUS +:
                A
      She went all the way, all the way
                   B
      All the way down, yeah
                A
      She went all the way
      All the way, all the way
                                B
      All the way, all the way down


BREAK:
              E            B       A
      She's there when I close my eyes
       A             B       E      A   B
      There when I close my eyes
              E            B       A
      She's there when I close my eyes
        A            B       E     A   B
      There when I close my eyes


VERSE:
      How the years they rush on by
      Birthdays, kids and suicides
      Still I play the fool and strut
      Still you're a slut


CHORUS +:
                          A
      Hey girl, she went all the way
      All the way, all the way
                   B
      All the way down
                A
      She went all the way
      All the way, all the way
                    B
      All the way down
                A
      She went all the way
      All the way, all the way
                   E
      All the way down


INSTRUMENTAL:    E   B   E
                 E   B   E
                 E   B   E


VERSE:
      You give me back that time right now
      I can see it if I close my eyes
      Was every minute just a waste?
      Was every hour a foolish chase?
      I don't believe it


CHORUS +:
      She went all the way
      All the way down
      She went all the way
      All the way down
      She went all the way
      All the way down
      She went all the way
      All the way, all the way
      All the way down
