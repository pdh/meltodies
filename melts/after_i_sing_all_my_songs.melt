After I Sing All My Songs

G                         D7           G
When the show is over and every one is gone
C                                     G
That's when this lonely feeling comes along
                   G7                      G
Everybody loves me while the show is going on
    C                 G        D7                  G
But I need someone to love me  after I sing all my songs

                                 D7                 G
I smile and play the music while they just cheer me on
    C                                   G
But this empty feeling keeps on hanging on
                           G7                 G
Lord I wish I had somebody just to be my only one
  C               G        D7                  G
I need someone to hold me  after I sing all my songs

D7                                       G
After I sing my songs after the crowd is gone
  C               G        D7                  G
I need someone to hold me  after I sing all my songs

D7                                       G
After I sing my songs after the crowd is gone
  C               G        D7                  G
I need someone to hold me  after I sing all my songs
