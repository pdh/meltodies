I feel a rumblin' in her ground
I feel a rumblin'
I feel a rumblin' in her ground
I feel a rumblin'

When will I learn how to listen
G                 F#m
When will I learn how to feel
Bm                A
When will I learn how to give back

When will I learn how to give back

When will I learn how to heal

I can feel the weather changing
G     A           E
I can see it all around
       A D
All around

Can't you feel the new wind blowing
G           A              E
  Don't you recognize that sound
     A  D
That sound

Bm               A
But the earth is slowly spinning
G                F#m
Spinning slowly, slowly changing
Bm     A                E
I feel something in the air

I feel a rumblin' in her ground
I feel a rumblin'
I feel a rumblin' in her ground
I feel a rumblin'

I feel a rumblin'
I feel a rumblin' in her ground
I feel a rumblin'

When will I ... When will I ...
