This is my own interpretation of this song and is not intended to precisely duplicate the original 
artist's version. My version is replete with chord extensions and is, therefore, easy to manipulate
 and make your own. I hope you enjoy!

Simple Reggae strumming (back-strum between beats - strum up once and then up-down on the next beat
 - repeat pattern until jam is done)  

e   9     9     2     2     4     4     2      5      5      3           
B   10    10    3     3     5     5     3      2      3      2
G   9     12    2     5     4     7     4      2      2      2

A   x     x     x     x     x     x     x      x      x      x
E   x     x     x     x     x     x     x      x      x      x
  
    A     A7    D     D7    E     E7    Bm   * A ** Asus4 ** A7 * 

Each chord in the body of the tab represents two beats...strum up where you see the note and up/down
 where you see the backslash. I have tried to line the vocals as well as I could. 

(chorus) 
                     A          /          A          /          A          /          A7
          Don't   worry                         about a thing

          /          D          /          D7         /          A          /          A7
         cause every little thing          gonna be alright.

          /          A          /          A          /          A          /          A7  
  Singin' don't   worry                         about a thing

          /          D          /          D7         /          A          /          A7
         cause every little thing          gonna be alright.

(verse)
          /        * A *        /       * Asus4 *     /          E          /          E7
   Rise up this mornin'                       smiled with the rising   sun

          /          D          /          D          /          Bm         /          D7     
 three little birds                          perch by my     doorstep

          /        * A *        /        * A7 *       /          E          /          E7  
      singing sweet songs                     of melodies pure   and true

          /          D          D7         E          E7         A          /          A 
     sayin'         "this is    my     message to    you".

(chorus) (verse) (chorus)

The final chorus is repeated until the song fades out with some minor improvised 
changes in the wording. 
For those anal retentive types, the word "with" is changed to "at" the second time 
the verse is sung. I hope you enjoy!
