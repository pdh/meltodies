Hey I just remembered i figured this out in 6th grade. Im in 10th grade now. But 
yeah i just remembered and theres not a tab for this song online. so here it is. A 
beautiful song. Just some background info, in 6th grade we had a fundraiser dinner 
at school, and we were learning about racial discrimination. So i decided to learn 
this song and had some classmates sing it. we also played Hey There Delilah and i 
played a classical song on my guitar. And as always, I love you Jeannette&lt;3 hope you do too

Oh btw Capo on 2nd fret and then play the chords. Part of the song goes to 
arpeggio, which is just straight down from 6th to 1st string
E                                       A
Come round by my side &amp; I'll sing you a song
      E                      D           E
I'll sing it so softly it'll do no one wrong
   E                      E
On Birmingham Sunday the blood ran like wine
          D                     E
And the choirs kept singing of freedom

E                                         A
That cold autumn morning no eyes saw the sun
     E                      D           B7
And Addie Mae Collins, her number was "one"
       E           B7               E
At an old baptist church there was no need to run
          D                     E
And the choirs kept singing of freedom

E                                              A
The clouds they were grey and the autumn winds blew
     E                         D         B7
And Denise McNair brought the number to "two"
        E            B7         E
The falcon of death was the creature they knew
          D                      E
And the choirs kept singing of freedom

E                                        A
The church it was crowded, but no one could see
      E                      D           B7
That Cynthia Wesley's dark number was "three"
       E               B7          E
Her prayers and her feeling would shame you and me
          D                      E
And the choirs kept singing of freedom

E                                  A
Young Carol Robertson entered the door
        E                      D           B7
And the number her killers had given was "four"
     E             B7          E
She asked for a blessing but asked for no more
          D                      E
And the choirs kept singing of freedom

E                                        A
On Birmingham Sunday a noise shook the ground
          E              D             B7
And the people all over earth turned around
E           B7        E
For no on recalled a more cowardly sound
          D                       E
And the choirs kept singing of freedom

E                                     A
The men in the forest they once asked of me
     E                  D               B7
How many blackberries grow in the blue sea
E                 B7         E
And i asked them right back with a tear in my eye
       D                     E
How many dark ships in the forest?

E                                       A
The Sunday has come and the Sunday has gone
        E                  D                B7
And I can't do much more than to sing you a song
E             B7              E
I'll sing it so softly it'll do no one wrong
          D                       E
And the choirs kept singing of freedom
