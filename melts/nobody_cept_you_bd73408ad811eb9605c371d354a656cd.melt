NOBODY 'CEPT YOU- Bob Dylan

          F              C                 F
There's nothing 'round here to me that's sacred
       Dm        Bb
'Cept you, yeah you
             F          C                 F
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters
      Dm        Bb
'Cept you, yeah you

  Bb
You're the one that reaches me
            F
You're the one that I admire
  Bb
Every time we meet together
    F
I feel like I'm on fire
   Bb
Nothing matters to me
             F          Dm
And there's nothing I desire
       Bb        Gm
'Cept you, yeah you

Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah you
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah you

There's a hymn I used to hear
In the churches all the time
Make me feel so good inside
So peaceful, so sublime
And there's nothing that reminds me of that
Old familiar chime, except you, yeah you

BRIDGE:
 Bb
Used to run in the cemetery
                                     F
Dance and run and sing but I was a child
C                      F
And it never seemed strange
     Bb
But now I just pass mournfully
                                       F
By that place where bones of life are piled
C                      F
I know somethin' has changed 

I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah you
Nothing any more seems to please me,except you, yeah you

Nothing hypnotizes me
Or holds me in a spell
Everything runs by me
Just like water from a well
Everybody wants my attention
Everybody's got something to sell
        Bb       Gm
Except you, yeah you
                  F
I'm in love with you!
