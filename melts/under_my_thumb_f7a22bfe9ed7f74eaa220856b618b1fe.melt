C        Em
Under my thumb,
    D        C
The girl who once had me down
         Em
Under my thumb,
    D        C
The girl who once pushed me around

             G
It s down to me,
    C                 A
The difference in the clothes she wears
        Em                 D
Down to me, the change has come,
      C        G
She s under my thumb

Ain t it the truth babe? 

C        Em
Under my thumb,
    D                   C
The squirming dog who s just had her day
         Em
Under my thumb,
  D            C
A girl who has just changed her ways

             G
It s down to me, yes it is,
    C                 A
The way she does just what she s told

Down to me, the change has come,
      C        G

  D       C
A Siamese cat of a girl
         Em
Under my thumb,
          D               C
She s the sweetest, hmmm, pet in the world

             G
It s down to me,
    C                        A
The way she talks when she s spoken to

Down to me, the change has come,

She s under my thumb

Ah, take it easy babe

The way she talks when she s spoken to
        Em                 D
Down to me, the change has come,
      C        G
She s under my thumb

Say, its alright.
