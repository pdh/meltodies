intro: F#M - E - F#M - E   

Verse 1:
   A                   D
If I drove a truck And I were a waitress
    A                    A            E
And I ordered coffee And I poured you some
D                          A
Then you'd stop by on your way sometimes later
       A
And if we arm-wrestled
     E            A
I'd say that you won

chorus:

   F#M          E                     D                      A    E
    Ai-eeee my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
            A  A/C#   D
    If your loving is good
          E             A
    And your cooking ain't greasy
           A      A/C#    D         E          A
    we'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

Verse 2:
   A                 D                A                       A            E
If I were a winsome pale senorita And I a bull-fighter, way down in the sand
          D                          A
While the band kept on playing that Old Paso Doable
             A
Would you throw me a flower
          E         A
Would you take my hand?

chorus:

   F#M          E                     D                      A    E
    Ai-eeee my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
         A  A/C#   D 
    If your loving is good
          E             A
    And your cooking ain't greasy
           A      A/C#    D         E          A
    we'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

Verse 3:
   A                     D                       A 
If I ran the country I'd be your first lady and fix up the white house 
      A          E
while you were away
  D                            A                      A
Waiting while you're passing time with world leaders Left alone together
 E              A
Alone we might lay

chorus:

   F#M          E                     D                      A    E 
    Ai-eeee my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
        A  A/C#   D
    If your loving is good
          E             A
    And your cooking ain't greasy
           A      A/C#    D         E          A
    we'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away
         A  A/C#   D
    If your loving is good

    we'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away
           A      A/C#    D         E          A
    we'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away
  A
  Hey! (fade out...)
