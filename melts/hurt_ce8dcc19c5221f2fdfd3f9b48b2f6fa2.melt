I noticed there are no tabs with the lyrics and chords placed properly. This
 is for all the singers out there. I know it helps me to put everything 
together this way. Enjoy!Comments and Ratings Appreciated! Thanks Johnny!

  C       D      Am
I hurt myself today 
   C      D       Am
To see if I still feel 
  C     D      Am
I focus on the pain 
    C    D             Am
The only thing that's real 
    C      D        Am
The needle tears a hole
    C      D      Am
The old familiar sting 
       C       D    Am
Try to kill it all away
      C        D    G 
But I remember everything 

[Chorus:]

Am          F
What have I become 
C           G
My sweetest friend
Am         F         C
Everyone I know goes away 
       G
In the end 
    Am                F
And you could have it all
G
My empire of dirt
Am             F 
I will let you down 
G
I will make you hurt 

Am  C  D  Am (x2)

  C         D        Am
I wear this crown of thorns
C       D       Am 
Upon my liar's chair
C       D       Am 
Full of broken thoughts
C    D     Am
I cannot repair
C           D          Am
Beneath the stains of time
    C        D    Am 
The feelings disappear 
C       D       Am
You are someone else
C    D           G 
I am still right here 

[Chorus:]

Am          F
What have I become
C           G 
My sweetest friend 
Am         F         C
Everyone I know goes away
       G 
In the end 
    Am                F
And you could have it all
G 
My empire of dirt 
Am             F
I will let you down
G 
I will make you hurt 
   Am             F
If I could start again
  G 
A million miles away
Am           F 
I would keep myself 
G
I would find a way
