Intro:  | G | Am7 | G Gsus | Am7 Am7* | G |


  Bm          G *Gsus G    Bm             G *Gsus G
    Childhood living           is easy to do
  Am               C       *D G *Gsus G         D *Dsus2 D
    the things you wanted     I bought them for you
  Bm          G *Gsus G    Bm               G *Gsus G
    Graceless lady           you know who I am
  Am                 C       *D G *Gsus G         D Dsus2 D
    You know I can't let you     slide through my hands


Chorus:
   Am         C        *D G         F      C  *Bm
     Wild      Horses     couldn't drag me away
   Am         C        *D G         F      C
     wild wild horses     couldn't drag me away



  Bm              G *Gsus G    Bm             G *Gsus G
    I watched you suffer        A dull aching pain
  Am           C        *D G *Gsus G        D *Dsus2 D
    Now you've decided       to show me the same
  Bm            G *Gsus G    Bm             G *Gsus G
    No sweeping exits          or off stage lines
  Am                   C       *D G *Gsus G       D Dsus2 D
    Could make me feel bitter      or treat you unkind



Chorus:
   Am         C        *D G         F      C  *Bm
     Wild      Horses     couldn't drag me away
   Am         C        *D G         F      C
     wild wild horses     couldn't drag me away

BRIDGE: | F C | F C | *D G Gsus G |G Gsus G |


  Bm            G *Gsus G    Bm             G *Gsus G
    I know I've dreamed you     a sin and a lie
  Am          C       *D G *Gsus G               D *Dsus2 D
    I have my freedom      but I don't have much time
  Bm               G *Gsus G    Bm             G *Gsus G
    Faith has been broken,       tears must be cried
  Am              C       *D G *Gsus G   D *Dsus2 D
    Let's do some living,    after we'll die

Chorus 2:

   Am         C        *D G         F      C  *Bm
     Wild      Horses     couldn't drag me away
   Am         C        *D G     F              C
     wild wild horses     we'll ride them some day

Interlude: | Bm | G | Bm | G | Am | C D | G | Dsus2 |

   Am         C        *D G         F      C  *Bm
     Wild      Horses     couldn't drag me away
   Am         C        *D G     F              C   D G
     wild wild horses     we'll ride them some day
