G             C
Feel like I'm falling 
G               C           Fmaj7
Falling off the face of the earth 

Falling off the face of the earth 
G             C
Feel like I'm falling 
G               C           Fmaj7
Falling off the face of the earth 

Falling off the face of the earth

(Verse 2) Do same as first verse G C  G C Fmaj7

I just want to tell you 

You sure mean a lot to me 

It may sound simple 

But you are the world to me 

It's such a precious thing 

That time we shared together 

I must apologize 

For the troubled times 



(Chorus)


Feel like I'm falling 

Falling off the face of the earth 

Feel like I'm falling 

Falling off the face of the earth 

Falling off the face of the earth 

Oh... 

Feel like I'm falling 

Falling off the face of the earth 

Falling off the face of the earth 

Falling off the face of the earth 

 
Feel like I'm falling 

Falling off the face of the earth 
 
Feel like I'm falling 

Falling off the face of the earth
