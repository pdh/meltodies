Walking The Long Miles Home 

       G 
Oh the last bus has gone or maybe I'm wrong
        D7
It just doesn't exist 
        G
And the words that flew between me and you
          D7
I must be crossed off your list 

       C           D          G     C       D           G
So I'm walking the long miles home, I don't mind losing you
   C           D           Em
In fact I feel better each step of the way
       C        D              Em
In the dark I rehearse all the right things to say
        C             D        Em       A
I'll be home, I'll be sober by break of day
C           D          G     
Walking the long miles home

Not a soul is around as I put more ground
Between me and you
And the whole town's asleep or maybe they're deep 
In the old "voulez vous"

So I'm walking the long miles home and I don't mind losing you
Got the moon there for company each step of the way
And the rhythm in my shoes keep the blues all away
When you ride Shanks's Pony you don't have to pay
Walking the long miles home

Oh the party was grand but I hadn't quite planned 
On staying so long
And while you accused me, the hours confused me 
And my friends had all gone

So I'm walking the long miles home and I don't mind losing you
Ah there's nobody out but the cop on the beat
He's snoring so loud I don't hear my feet
I just laugh to myself and move off down the street
Walking the long miles home
I'm walking the long miles home
Oh walking the long miles home
