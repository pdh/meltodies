Tune down half a step to play. Chords in relation to tuning.

verse1
N.C                             E
Gee but it's great to be back home 
Home is where I want to be 
                            A 
I've been on the road so long my friend

And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
E                             C#m 
Two steps away from the county line

                             A
You better get your bags and flee
You're in trouble boy,
