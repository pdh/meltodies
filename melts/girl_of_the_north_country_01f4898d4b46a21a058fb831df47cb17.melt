G         Bm                C             G 
If you're travellin' in the North Country fair. 
G                   Bm           C     G 
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline. 
G        Bm    C             G        
Remember me to one who lives there. 
G           Bm     C            G 
For she was once a true love of mine. 
 
 
G      Bm           C          G  
If you go where the snowflakes fall. 
G          Bm     C          G 
The rivers freeze and summer ends 
G              Bm       C                  G 
Please see for me she's wearing a coat sow warm. 
G           Bm       C       G 
To keep her from the howling winds. 
 
 
G              Bm          C              G 
Please see for me that her hair's hanging down. 
G          Bm    C             G  
Her golden curls roll down her breast. 
G              Bm          C              G 
Please see for me that her hair's hanging down. 
G                Bm      C          G 
Cause that's the way I remember her best. 
 
 
G            Bm                C             G 
So if you're travellin' in the North Country fair. 
G                   Bm           C     G 
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline. 
G        Bm    C             G 
Remember me to one who lives there. 
G           Bm     C            G 
For she was once a true love of mine.

G        Bm       C          G 
Wondrin' if she remembers at all 
G    Bm    C          G 
Many times I've often prayed 
G      Bm       C     G 
In the darkness of my night 
G      Bm         C     G 
In the brightness of my day 
 
 
G            Bm                C             G 
So if you're travellin' in the North Country fair. 
G                   Bm           C     G 
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline. 
G        Bm    C             G 
Remember me to one who lives there.
