        G                        D  
Good-bye Joe, he gotta go, me oh my oh
                                     G
He gotta go-pole the pirogue down the bayou
                                  D
His Yvonne the sweetest one, me oh my oh
                                       G
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou



Thibodaux, Fontaineaux the place is buzzin'
A Kin-folk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style the go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou


Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
For tonight, I'm a-gonna see my my-my cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou


Settle down far from town get him a pirogue
And he'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Swap his mon to buy Yvonne what she need-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
