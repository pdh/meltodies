SIGN ON THE WINDOW- Bob Dylan

 G           Em           F   G
Sign on the window says "lonely"
 G           Em             F         C
Sign on the door said "no company allowed"
 G           Em                    F   C
Sign on the street says "y' don't own me"
 G   Bm      Em     G      C    G   Am
Sign on the porch says "three's a crowd"
 G    Bm     Em     G    A      C    G    C G  C G  C G  C G
Sign on the porch says "three's a crowd"

Her and her boyfriend went to California
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune
My best friend said "now didn't I warn ya
Brighton girls are like the moon
Brighton girls are like the moon"

BRIDGE:
C D Eb            Dm               C
    Looks like a-nothing but the rain
G              Bm             C     Am
Sure gonna be wet tonight on main street
 Em                D        Am G Am7 G Em F G
Hope that it don't sleet

Build me a cabin in Utah
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa"
That must be what it's all about
That must be what it's all about
