Automobile by Gospel Music feat. Tracyanne Campbell from Camera Obscura.
 
A
I've got a little Honda, it ain't much but it's paid for
      BM            C#m            D               E
He's got a little Honda, it ain't much but it's paid for
A
Two doors is too few doors, two more doors makes for four doors
      Bm            C#m            D               E
Two doors is too few doors, two more doors makes for four doors
A
Most times it's just a way to get from A to B
Bm 
But B turns into C then D occasionally
C#m                            D                     E
That's when I don't call it a car - I call it an automobile
 

A                D
Automobile, take me away
A                                            D
Take me to the forest, to the mountains, to the bay
                    Bm    D
Take me where the trees
                    Bm    D
Slow dance with the breeze

A                D
Automobile, take me away
A                           D
To Ipanema, to Morocco, to Bombay
                    Bm    D
Take me where palm trees
                 Bm    D
Sway in the seabreeze
A
Automobile!


A
Lover, our love notes have fallen off the major scale
    Bm            C#m            D               E
Lover, it's as if our love could use a stiff cocktail
A
So let's take a little trip, over hill and over dale
      Bm            C#m            D               E
Let's take a little trip, but not by rail and not by sail
A
Blind spots are on our hearts - let's get a better view
Bm
If you can't see my tears, I can't see you
C#m                         D                     E
Darling, don't you call it a car - call it an automobile


A                     D
Automobile, take us away
A                                    D
To another year, another month, another day
                  Bm  D
To the first time we
                  Bm  D
Slow danced by the sea

Tamales in banana leaves

A                     D
Automobile, take us away
