  *THEN PLAY:    Dm  C    Dm  C    Bb -- 2x's

  *NOTE: PLAY THE ABOVE BEAT AND CHORDS FOR THE CHORUS THROUGHOUT



*CHORUS:        Dm           C      Dm           C         Bb  
       Give me just another night, just another night with you
     * Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn breaks through
     *'Cause I'm homesick, feel a little down and blue
     * And I'm hurting, hurting baby just like you


VERSE:
              C                             F
       I was lonely 'til I saw you at the station
              C                                  G
       And I never thought you'd keep our rendevous
                   F
       Baby it's true


*CHORUS:
      * Give me just another night, just another night with you
      * Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn breaks through
      * 'Cause I'm hungry, hungry for your loving baby
      * And I'm thirsty, thirsty for your loving baby


VERSE:
              C                            F
       And a one-day pass to heaven is so hard to find
              C                                  G
       And a one-night pass ain't what I really had in mind

BREAK:
       C  G          Bb   F
       I need your sweet tenderness
       C  G         Bb     F
       I need your soft caress
       C  G       Bb       F
       I know the day is coming
        G
       Don't take away your loving
        F
       Can't you see that I'm human


INSTRUMENTAL:  SOLO OVER THE CHORDS TO CHORUS AND VERSE


BREAK: 
       Just because you've seen my face
       Just because you know my name
       I'm a stranger in this town
       Can't I have my ups and downs?
       Can't you see that I'm human?

** PLAY OPENING BASS RIFF ONCE THEN

**INTERLUDE:
       I get hungry, get thirsty      }
       I get moody, I need attention  }  ** CONTINUE PLAYING 
       I need your love               }     OPENING BASS RIFF
       I need your love               }     OVER AND OVER
       I want your love               }


CHORUS:
       Give me just another night, just another night with you
       'Cause I'm freezing in this hundred dollar hotel room
       Don't make me leave you, don't you be so cruel.
