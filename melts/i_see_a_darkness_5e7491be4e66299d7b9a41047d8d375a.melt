You may wanna capo the 1st fret and play the F's like E's and the Bb's like A's, and then play Dm, C, and Am
as bar chords.


Intro: Bb F Bb F F Dm

                F     Bb
Well you're my friend
             F   Bb   Dm
And can you see
Dm
Many times we've been out drinking
Dm                            F       Dm
Many times we've shared our thoughts
Dm
But did you ever, ever notice
Dm                       Bb     Am
the kinds of thoughts I got
                       Dm
Well you know I have a love
                       Bb     Am
a love for everyone I know
                       Dm
And you know I have a drive
                    Bb      Am
to live I won't let go
                    Dm                Bb                  Dm
But can you see its opposition comes rising up sometimes
                                                        Bb
That it's dreadful and positioned comes blacking in my mind

Bb               F
And that I see a darkness
                 Bb
And that I see a darkness
                 F
And that I see a darkness
                 Bb
And that I see a darkness
                         F
Did you know how much I love you?
                            Bb                        F            Dm
Is there hope that somehow you can save me from this darkness?

Dm             					      F
Well I hope that someday buddy, we have peace in our lives
             Dm                       F
Together or apart, alone or with our wives
                     Dm
And we can stop our whoreing
                     Bb
And pull the smiles inside
                 F
And light it up forever
                 Am
And never go to sleep
                  C
My best unbeaten brother
                 Am       Bb
This isn't all I see

Bb                F
Although I see a darkness
		  Bb
Although I see a darkness
		F
I know I see a darkness
		Bb
I know I see a darkness
			 F
Did you know how much I love you?
			    Bb			      F
Is there hope that somehow you can save me from this darkness?
