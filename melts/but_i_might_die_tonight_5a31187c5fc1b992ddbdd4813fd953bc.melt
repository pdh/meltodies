This song was recently posted in CRD format.  Unfortunately, for several
reasons, CRD does not meet my needs and I wanted the song in SIMP (text)
format (with a few changes).  I assume there are at least a few people out

my needs.  I would hope that there are enough people using this group to
justify and support more than one format.)
