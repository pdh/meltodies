Intro: A E A E E Dm*

                E     A
Well you're my friend
             E   A   Dm*
And can you see
Dm*
Many times we've been out drinking
Dm*                            E       Dm*
Many times we've shared our thoughts
Dm*
But did you ever, ever notice
Dm*                       A     Am*
the kinds of thoughts I got
                       Dm*
Well you know I have a love
                       A     Am*
a love for everyone I know
                       Dm*
And you know I have a drive
                    A      Am*
to live I won't let go
                    Dm*                A                  Dm*
But can you see its opposition comes rising up sometimes
                                                        A
That it's dreadful and positioned comes blacking in my mind

A               E
And that I see a darkness
                 A
And that I see a darkness
                 E
And that I see a darkness
                 A
And that I see a darkness
                         E
Did you know how much I love you?
                    A                        E            Dm*
Is there hope that somehow you can save me from this darkness?

Dm*             					      E
Well I hope that someday buddy, we have peace in our lives
             Dm*                       E
Together or apart, alone or with our wives
                     Dm*
And we can stop our whoreing
                     A
And pull the smiles inside
                 E
And light it up forever
                 Am*
And never go to sleep
                  C*
My best unbeaten brother
                 Am*       A
This isn't all I see

A                E
Although I see a darkness
		  A
Although I see a darkness
		E
I know I see a darkness
		A
I know I see a darkness
			 E
Did you know how much I love you?
			    A			      E
Is there hope that somehow you can save me from this darkness?
