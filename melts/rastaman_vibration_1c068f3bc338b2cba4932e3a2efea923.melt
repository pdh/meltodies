F#m
 If you get down and you quarrel everyday,
You're saying prayers to the devils, I say.
Bm
 Why not help one another on the way?

Make it much easier, (just a little bit easier).
Say you just can't live that negative way,
If you know what I mean; make way for the positive day.

'Cos its news, news and days,
D         C#m

Said its a new sign;  oh, what a new day.
