E        Esus4 E     F#m  C#m         E
Heels of children running wild in the sun
E      A              D             F#m7        E   E/D#
like a forest is your child growing wild in the sun
C#m           B                A   A G#m F#m E
Doomed in his innocence in the sun.

E           E4   E      F#m  C#m         E
Gather your children to your side in the sun
E         A                  D              F#m7        E    E/D#
tell them all they love will die, tell them why, in the sun
C#m            B            A         G#m F#m E
tell them it's not too late for today one by one
C#m          B             A C D Am  C#m    E
tell them to harvest and rejoice --- in the sun.
