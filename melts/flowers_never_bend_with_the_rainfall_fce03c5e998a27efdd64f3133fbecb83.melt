FLOWERS NEVER BEND
Paul Simon 


G                       Bm7
Through the corridors of sleep
        C9              G
Past the shadows dark and deep
Bm                      C9          G    C  G
My mind dances and leaps in confusion.
G                       Bm
I dont know what is real,
        C9              G
I can't touch what I feel
        Bm              C9              G
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion.


D       C               G               Em
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
Am7                 Em
My life will never end,
       A           C
And flowers never bend
            Gsus4  G
With the rainfall.



G               Bm7
The mirror on my wall
        C9              G
Casts an image dark and small
Bm                C9                G         C  G
But Im not sure at all its my reflection.
G               Bm7
I am blinded by the light
 C9                    G
Of God and truth and right
        Bm         C9                   G         C  G
And I wander in the night without direction.


D       C               G               Em
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
Am7                 Em
My life will never end,
       A           C
And flowers never bend
            Gsus4  G
With the rainfall.


     G                  Bm7
Its no matter if youre born
        C9              G
To play the king or pawn
      Bm                C9                      G         C  G
For the line is thinly drawn tween joy and sorrow,
G       Bm7
So my fantasy
 C9         G
Becomes reality
        Bm              C9              G         C  G
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow.


D       C               G               Em
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
Am7                 Em
My life will never end,
       A           C
And flowers never bend
            Gsus4  G
With the rainfall.
