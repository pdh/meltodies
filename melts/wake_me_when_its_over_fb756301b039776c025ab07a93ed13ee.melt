Wake Me When Its Over - Willie Nelson


C
Well I'm getting tired now I gotta get some sleep now
  F                                C
I guess I've been worried much too long

And don't wake me until it's over 
         D7              G7
Till the need for you is gone

         C
I was so happy before I loved you 
          F               C
I want to be like I was before
                           D7
So don't wake me until it's over 
       G7                C
When I won't want you anymore

   F
My mind is getting weak now I gotta get some sleep now 
        C
I gotta rest my aching head
  F
I just wanna lay here Now just let me stay here
         D7               G7
Till the blues get up and leave my bed

          C
Goodnight darling, good night darling 
    F           C
Goodnight forevermore
                            D7
And don't wake me until it's over 
       G7         F      C
When I won't want you anymore

Soloâ€¦.

   F
My eys are getting weak now I gotta get some sleep now 
        C
I gotta rest my aching head
  F
Now just let me lay here let me stay here
         D7               G7
Till the blues get up and leave my bed

          C
Goodnight darling, good night darling 
    F           C
Goodnight forevermore
                            D7
And don't wake me... until it's over 
       G7         F      C
When I won't want you anymore

                           D7
And don't wake me... until it's over 
       G7                      F      C
When your sure thatI won't want you anymore
