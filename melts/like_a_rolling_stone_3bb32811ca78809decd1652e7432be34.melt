LIKE A ROLLING STONE
by BOB DYLAN




G                     Am7               
Once upon a time, you dressed so fine,
Em7                    C              D           D
Threw the bums a dime, in your prime, didn't you?
G                 Am7                  Em7
People call, say "Beware, doll, you're bound to fall."
    C                     D           D
You thought they were all kiddin' you.
C           D                   C                  D
You used to laugh about         Everybody that was hangin' out,
C           Em7   Am7     G     C       Em7   Am7     G
But now you don't talk so loud, Now you don't seem so proud,
Am                                      D     D
About havin' to be scroungin' your next meal.
D           G     C  D          D           G     C  D
How does it feel?               How does it feel.
D           G     C  D          D             G    C  D
To be on your own.              With no direction home.   
D             G    C  D         D             G    C  D
A complete unknown.             Like a rollin' stone.

You've gone to the finest schools, alright, Miss Lovely,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
You never had to live out on the street,
But now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulders a Siamese cat.
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Never understood that it ain't no good.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
You said you'd never compromise
With the Mystery Tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And he says, "Do you want to make a deal?"

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they've got it made.
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts,
You'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe.
You used to be so amused
At Napolean in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now he calls you you can't refuse
When you got nothin' you got nothin' to lose
Your invisible now you've got no secrets to conceal.
