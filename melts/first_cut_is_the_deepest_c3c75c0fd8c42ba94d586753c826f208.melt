Verse 1
             G*        D*         C*   D*
I would have given you all of my heart
            G*            C*          D*   C*
but there's someone who's torn it a - part
          G*           D*            C*
and she's taken almost all that I've got
     D*              G*               D*    C*
but if you want, I'll try to love a - gain

   The first cut is the deepest,
D       G
baby I know

The first cut is the deepest
               G              D          C       D
'cause when it comes to being lucky she's cursed
         G              C        D     C
when it comes to lovin' me she's worst
            G                 D           C
but when it comes to being in love she's first
       D
that's how I know

   The first cut is the deepest,

The first cut is the deepest
