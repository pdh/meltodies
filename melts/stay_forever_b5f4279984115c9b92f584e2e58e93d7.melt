This is one of my favorite songs and i play it this way: 
 
Capo IV

-Verse 1-
A               E               Bm         Cm#
In the morning sun, I couldn't tell you
A               E               Bm         Cm#
I couldn't tell you so many things
A               E               Bm         Cm#
About how much I really love you
A               E               Bm         Cm#
About how much you really mean 

-Bridge-
A        E                       Bm        Cm#
So far away but it's so easy to see you
A        E                       Bm
When I'm away I want to put my arms around you

-Chorus-
E             A            D
And I wanna know, do you feel the same way?
D             A            E
'Cause if you do I wanna stay forever
E             A            D
And I want to know, do you feel the same way?
D             A            E
'Cause if you do I wanna stay forever
E
With you

Verse 2:
A          E             Bm             Cm#
So many colors that surround you
A          E                 Bm         Cm#
Some so bright I can hardly see
A            E                Bm                        Cm#
A light reflects on all the things that make you real
A             E              Bm         Cm#
Things that make you truly free


-Bridge-
A        E                       Bm        Cm#
So far away but it's so easy to see you
A        E                       Bm
When I'm away I want to put my arms around you
 

-Chorus-
E             A            D
And I wanna know, do you feel the same way?
D             A            E
'Cause if you do I wanna stay forever
E             A            D
And I want to know, do you feel the same way?
D             A            E
'Cause if you do I wanna stay forever
E             A            D
And I want to know, do you feel the same way?
D             A            E
'Cause if you do I wanna stay forever
E                          C
With you
