How many roads must a man walk down
F          Bb        C
Before you call him a man?

Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail

Before she sleeps in the sand?

Before they're forever banned?

Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
F             Bb           C
Before he can hear people cry?
         F        Bb             F
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
F            Bb           C
That too many people have died?

F        Bb          F
How many years can a mountain exist
F           Bb            C
Before it's washed to the sea?
         F        Bb            F
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
F              Bb            C
Before they're allowed to be free?
         F        Bb          F   
Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head,
F            Bb            C
Pretending he just doesn't see?
     Bb         C          F

     Bb         C            F
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
