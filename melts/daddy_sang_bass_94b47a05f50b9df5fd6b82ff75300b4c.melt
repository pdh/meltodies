I reMember when I was a Lad
Now I remember after work

Times were Hard and things were Bad
Momma would call in all of us
*             *             A7/E7/A7
But there's a Silver Linin' Behind Every Cloud
You could hear us singin' for a country mile

We'd get together in a family circle       Singin'   Loud
We'll be together again up yonder in a   Little     While
