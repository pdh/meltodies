Capo 3rd fret


C  G/B  Am7  G   x 3

C       G/B      Am7       G
  Slow down, you move too fast
C            G/B      Am7       G
  You got to make the morning last
    C        G/B      Am7     G
Just kicking down the cobblestones
C             G/B     Am7       G
  Looking for fun and feelin' groovy

C  G/B  Am7  G

         C     G/B   Am7      G
Ba-da-da da-da da-da, feelin' groovy

C  G/B  Am7  G

C       G/B       Am7      G
  Hello lamp-post, whatcha knowin'?
C              G/B        Am7     G
  I've come to watch your flowers growin'
C           G/B    Am7        G
  Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
C          G/B      Am7       G
  Doo-it'n doo-doo, feelin' groovy

C  G/B  Am7  G

         C     G/B          Am7      G
Ba-da-da da-da da-da da-da, feelin' groovy

C  G/B  Am7  G

         C           G/B    Am7         G
I've got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
    C           G/B        Am7      G
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
        C            G/B          Am7       G
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
C         G/B       Am7      G
  Life, I love you, all is groovy

C  G/B  Am7  G    repeat to fade
