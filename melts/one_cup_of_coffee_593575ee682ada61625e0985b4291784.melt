Eb
 One cup of coffee, then I'll go;

Though I just dropped by to let you know.
         Eb             Eb7
That I'm leaving you to-morrow;
     Ab
I'll cause you no more sorrow;

 One cup of coffee, then I'll go.

I brought the money like the lawyer said to do,
                                             Bb7
But it won't replace the heartaches I caused you.
   Eb                      Eb7           Ab
It won't take the place of lovin' you, I know,
    Eb         Bb7              Eb
So; one cup of coffee then I'll go.

 Tell the kids I came last night,

 Just the way you used to lie in my arms.
