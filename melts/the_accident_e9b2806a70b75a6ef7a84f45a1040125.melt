G
Last night I saw an accident
       C                   G
on the corner of Third and Green
G
two cars collided and I got excited
     A7                 D
just being part of that scene


G
It was Mrs. Tom Walker and her beautiful daughter
                        C
Pamela, was driving the car
                           G
they got hit by a man in a lite blue sedan
        D                   G
who had obviously been to a bar.



Chorus:
C                              G
They don't know how lucky they are
C                             D
they could have run into that tree
    G                   C
got struck by a bolt of lightning
    G          D     G
and raped by a minority.


G   
It was a four way stop dilemma 
   C                    G
we all arrived the same time
  G
I yielded to the man to the right of me 
       A7                       D
and he yielded it right back to mine
G
well the yield went around and around and around 
                    C
till Pamela finally tried
                         G
just then the man in the light blue sedan
    D                  G
hit Pamela's passenger side.



(Repeat Chorus)


G
Pamela hit her head on the mirror
    C                        G
Mrs Walker got a bump on the knee
G
the man hit himself in the face and said
A7                      D
Why does this happen to me?
G
the neighbors came out
G
and they gathered about
G                        C
saying Hey! who hit who anyway?
                            G
and the police arrived at a quarter to five
               D               G
and pronounced all the victims Okay



(Repeat Chorus)
