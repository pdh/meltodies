C                 G7                  C
I like to play my music and have good times 
F                                            C
I love to hear an old train rolling down the line 
F                                 C
I am in to happy and I don't like sad 
               G7               C
I like to have women I've never had 

                   G7                 C
I'll take a little smoke and a lot of wine 
F                                  C
I get high and call old friends of mine
F                                           C
I like the sweet young things with old granddad 
                   G7               C
And I like to have women I've never had 

                  G7                  C
I like to ride my horses and shoot my guns 
F                                      C
You know a cowboy's work is just never done 
F                                  C
I am in to basics and I don't like fads 
                   G7               C
And I like to have women I've never had 

                    G7                 C
Hey I don't mean to ever do anybody no wrong 
F                                     C
I was just born the son of a singer's song 
F                                 C
I do things that make some people mad 
                   G7               C
And I like to have women I've never had
