A/E                   G(A11)* 
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin', 
A/E             G(A11)*
I was layin' in bed 
A/E                G(A11)*
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all 
       D
If her hair was still red. 


Her folks they said our lives together 

Sure was gonna be rough 

They never did like Mama's homemade dress 

Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough. 


    E                     F#m
And I was standin' on the side of the road 
A                  D
Rain fallin' on my shoes 
E                   F#m
Heading out for the East Coast 
     A                    D            E
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through, 
G       D     A/E   Asus*   A/E   Asus*
Tangled up in blue.

  

These are the same chords all the way thru, so have fun
