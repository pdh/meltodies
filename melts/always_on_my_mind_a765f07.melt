(I.E. where the chords are located in comparason to the words.
but you should be able to figure it out.

D              A
Maybe I didn't love you
Bm      D         G         A
Quite as often as I could have
D                  A
And maybe I didn't treat you
Bm       D         Em7
Quite as good as I should have
G                  D
If I made you feel second best
G         D           Em
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
A       Bm     A7    D     Em
But you were always on my mind
G      A7        D     G     A
You were always on my mind
D              A
Maybe I didn't hold you
Bm     D       G         A
All those lonely, lonely times
D                  A
And I guess I never told you
Bm       D         Em7
I'm so happy that you're mine
G                  D
Little things I should have said and done
G         D           Em
I just never took the time
A            Bm     A7    D     Em
You were always on my mind
G             A7      D   G   A
You were always on my mind
D     A  Bm    D
Tell       me
G            D               Em    G    A7
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
D     A Bm
Give     me
D           G          D            Em
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
     A                   D
I'll keep you satisfied

(End) A G A A7 D
