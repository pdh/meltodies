My Woman    John Prine
C G D G
.......
G                                  D
I could be happy as a sardine in a can
                  C            D
Just as long as I got.... My woman...
G                                          D
I could jump off a cliff and never have no fear
        C              D      C    G
Just as long as she is near...My woman...
C    G   D  G
mmm mmm mmm mmm
-------------------------
G                                            D
The cannibals could catch me and fry me in a pan
                  C            D
Just as long as I got ....My woman
G                                               D
I could run stark naked and live in an old oak tree
        C              D        C    G
just as long as she?s with me...My woman
C    G   D  G
mmm mmm mmm mmm
--------------------------
G                                                  D   D^D#
They could torcher me and stretch me like a rubber band
           C           D
long as I got ....My woman
G                                          D
I could get the lectric chair for a phoney rap
         C                  D    C    G
long as she?s sittin in my lap...My woman
C    G   D  G
mmm mmm mmm mmm fade out
C    G   D  G
mmm mmm mmm mmm
C    G   D  G
mmm mmm mmm mmm
