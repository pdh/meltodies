FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAT- Leonard Cohen

       Am                       F
It's four in the morning, the end of December
      Dm7                   Em7
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
   Am                     F
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
          Dm7                   Em7
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening
 Am                  Bm                   Am                Bm
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
 Am                 G
You're living for nothing now
   Am                                G
I hope you're keeping some kind of record

CHORUS #1:
           C                               G
Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
                             Am
She said that you gave it to her
                                    Bm  G
That night that you planned to go clear
F                  Em7
Did you ever go clear?

         Am
Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
And you came home without Lili Marlene
And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife

CHORUS #2:
         C                                   G
Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
                      Am
One more thin gypsy thief
                    Bm  G F               Em7
Well I see Jane's awake   she sends her regards

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way
If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free

CHORUS #3:
           C                          G
Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
                   Am                        G
I thought it was there for good so I never tried
      C                                G
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
                              Am
She said that you gave it to her
                                     Bm  G
That night that you planned to go clear
 F               Em7
Sincerely, L  Cohen


Dm7: x x 0 2 1 1  Em7: 0 2 2 0 3 0

NOTE: Technically speaking, the bottom E should drop down to D to get a
really low note for the Dm7.  All other chords should be changed
accordingly if you feel it worth the bother.  Also, the standard Cohen
picking pattern can be used on this song (see Winter Lady).

I got this off some archive awhile ago, can't remember which. Here are
the chord changes.
VERSE
Am F Dm7 G
Am F Dm7 G

BRIDGE
F F F G
Dm7 Dm7 Dm7 G

CHORUS
C C C C
G G G G
Am7 Am7 Am7 Am7
G G G G
Dm7 G

If you have the music, you can figure it out with these changes. Leonard
Cohen is a genius.
