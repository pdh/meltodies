Hey, I realise theres another tab for this on the site but it isn't the easiest to 
play if your a beginner. So I thought I'd do us all a favour and transpose the 
chords from the key of E to the Key of C.
I'm not sure if the chords change exactly where I've put them I just went over the 
song in my head...but anyway you can get the general places for the changes so 
work it out for yourselves.

Am         G         F         G        Am      G       F    G
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Am        G          F   G     Am   G     F    G
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Am      G          F      G       Am      G    F   G
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Am     G      F      G    Am    G       F          G
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."

Am        G     F      G     Am   G      F          G
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Am     G        F      G      Am   G        F           G
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Am         G     F     G         Am        G        F         G
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,
Am    G          F           G  Am    G      F       G    
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."

Am        G     F    G     Am     G     F    G
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
Am          G          F     G     Am   G     F       G    
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.
Am      G    F    G     Am    G     F    G
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Am   G      F    G           Am    G    F      G
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
