SITTIN' ON A FENCE by THE ROLLING STONES from the album FLOWERS

Chords by: Ted Saxlid.

F#                 Ab7                         C#
Since I was young I've been very hard to please
F#      Ab7                C#
And I don't know wrong from right
F#
But there is one thing I could never understand
Ab7
Some of the sick things that a girl does to a man, so

C#         F#              Ab      C#          F#                 Ab
I'm just sittin' on a fence you can say I got no sense
C#                     Eb                 Ab7               C#
Tryin' to make up my mind really is too hard a bind
F#         Ab7           C#
So I'm sittin' on a fence

F#            Ab7           C#
All of my friends at school grew up and settled down
F#              Ab7                  C#
Then they mortgaged up their lives
F#
When things got set too much but I think it's true
Ab7
They just get married ´cause they´ve nothing else to do, so

C#         F#              Ab      C#          F#                 Ab
I'm just sittin' on a fence you can say I got no sense
C#                     Eb                 Ab7               C#
Tryin' to make up my mind really is too hard a bind
F#         Ab7           C#
So I'm sittin' on a fence

F#        Ab7           C#
The day can come when you get old and sick and tired of life
F#           Ab7           C#
You just never rea-lise
F#
Maybe the choice you made wasn´t really right
Ab7
But you go out and you don´t come back at night, so


C#         F#              Ab      C#          F#                 Ab
I'm just sittin' on a fence you can say I got no sense
C#                     Eb                 Ab7               C#
Tryin' to make up my mind really is too hard a bind
F#         Ab7           C#
So I'm sittin' on a fence
