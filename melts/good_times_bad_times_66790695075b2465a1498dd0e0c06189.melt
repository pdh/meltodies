There may be a few more 7ths in there like on the F#, but I don't know for sure.  If it feels right play it! 
Otherwise, enjoy!

Intro:  E  E x 5
                E
1. In the days of my youth,
          D               A             E  - D - A
    I was told what it means to be a man.
       E
    Now I've reached that age,
                  D             A                  E  - D - A
    I've tried to do all those things the best I can.
            E                      D            A          E  - D - A
    No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam.
 
    A               G         A           G
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share,
        B7                E
when my woman left home for a brown-eyed man,
          B7             
well, I still don't seem to care.

2. Sixteen: I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be,
         
    it only took a couple of days till she was rid of me.
                
    She swore that she would be all mine, and love me till the end,
               
    but when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oooh.

Good times, bad times, you know I had my share,
        C#7                F#
when my woman left home for a brown-eyed man,
          C#7             
well, I still don't seem to care.

3. Oh, I know what it means to be alone,
E                          D     A
    I sure do wish I was at home.
E                         D             A
    I don't care what the neighbors say,
E                          D                A
    I'm gonna love you each and every day.
      E                               D    A
    You can feel the beat within my heart.
      E                        D                A
    realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part....
