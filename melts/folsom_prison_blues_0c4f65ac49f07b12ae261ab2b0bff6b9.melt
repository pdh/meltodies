  A
I hear the train a comin
      A
It's rollin' 'round the bend
         A
And I ain't seen the sunshine
         A
Since, I don't know when
      D
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
                                      A
And time keeps draggin' on
A              E
But that train keeps a-rollin'
                 A
On down to San Antone
A
When I was just a baby
A
My Mama told me, "Son
A
Always be a good boy

Don't ever play with guns"
        D
But I shot a man in Reno


                   A
Just to watch him die
            E
When I hear that whistle blowin'
                   A
I hang my head and cry

A
I bet there's rich folks eatin'
A
In a fancy dining car
A
They're probably drinkin' coffee
A
And smokin' big cigars
         D
But I know I had it comin'
                   A
I know I can't be free
               E
But those people keep a-movin'
                           A
And that's what tortures me
A
Well, if they freed me from this prison
A
If that railroad train was mine
A
I bet I'd move it on a little
A
Farther down the line
D
Far from Folsom Prison
                         A
That's where I want to stay
       E
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
                  A
Blow my blues away     HIT A 7 TIMES TO END
