License To Kill  by Bob Dylan
---------------  ------------

Transcribed by MH from Bob Dylan's (best!) album, "Infidels".
I have written this in the key of C so it can be easily transposed: to
play it in the original key (F#) put a capo on fret 6.
Modifications/discussions welcome.
**  The chords marked Fmaj7 and Csus4 I play as (xx3210) and (x33010),
    respectively.
*** The chord sequences for verses 2, 3 and 4 are the same as verse 1.

VERSE 1
C                    Am
Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth
       G                C
He can do with it as he please
       C            Am          G
And if things don't change soon, he will
    F                     C
Oh, man has invented his doom
      C        C        G   F
First step was touching the moon
              Am   F           Am   F
Now there's a woman on my block
             Am   F                  Am    F
She just sit there as the night grow still
        C               G                  C  Fmaj7 Csus4 C  **
She say who gonna take away his license to kill

VERSE 2 ***
Now, they take him and they teach him
And they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars
Now there's a woman on my block
She just sit there facin' the hill
She say who gonna take away his license to kill

VERSE 3
Now, he's hell bent for destruction
He's afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes they just tell him lies
But there's a woman on my block
Sitting there in a cold chill
She say who gonna take away his license to kill

       Am
May be noisemaker, spirit maker
C
Heartbreaker, backbreaker
F                  C
  Leave no stone unturned
          Am
May be an actor in a plot
              C
That might be all that you got
          Dm                 G
Till your error you clearly learn

VERSE 4
Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection he's fulfilled
Oh, man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way
Now, there's a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grow still
She say who gonna take away his license to kill

(instrumental verse)
