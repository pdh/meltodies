C       G7              C
Two cigarettes in an ashtray
            F             C
My love and I  in a small cafe
       F
Then a stranger came along
    C               A7
And everything went wrong
            D7                         G7
Now there's three cigarettes in the ashtray
 
C             F             C
I watched her take him from me
        F                    C
And his love is no longer my own
F
Now they are gone
    C     A7
And I sit alone
          F       G7         C
And watch one cigarette burn away

              F             C
I watched her take him from me
        F                    C
And his love is no longer my own
F
Now they are gone
    C     A7
And I sit alone
          F       G7         C
And watch one cigarette burn away
