Devil Woman
:Marty Robbins.

Capo 4

C                                                G
I told Mary about us, I told her about our great sin.
G7                                                C
Mary cried and forgave me, and Mary took me back again.
                                                 F
Said if I wanted my freedom, I could be free evermore.
                      C                   G7           C
But I don't wanna be, and I don't wanna see, Mary cry anymore.

CHORUS:
  G              G7              C        C7
Oh, devil woman, devil woman let go of me.
             G               G7                 C
Devil woman, let me be, and leave me alone, I wanna go home.

C                                                    G    G7
Mary is waitin' and weepin', down in our shack by the sea.
                                                    C
Even after I've hurt her, Mary's still in love with me.
                                                   F
Devil woman it's over, I'm trapped no more by your charms.
                          C                 G          G7        C
Cause I don't wanna stay, I wanna get away, woman let go of my arm.

CHORUS:
  G              G7              C        C7
Oh, devil woman, devil woman let go of me.
             G               G7                 C
Devil woman, let me be, and leave me alone, I wanna go home.

#3.
C                                                G
Devil woman you're evil, like the dark coral reef.
 G7                                                          C
Like the winds that bring high tides, you bring sorrow and grief.
                                           
                                   C7                           F
You made me ashamed to face Mary, I barely had the strength to tell
                        C      C7            G        G7          C
Skies are not so black, Mary took me back, Mary has broken your spell.

CHORUS:
  G              G7              C        C7
Oh, devil woman, devil woman let go of me.
             G               G7                 C
Devil woman, let me be, and leave me alone, I wanna go home.

#4.
C                                                   G
Running along by the seashore, running as fast as I can.
 G7                                                  C
Even the seagulls are happy, glad I'm coming home again.
                          C7                     F
Never again will I ever, cause another tear to fall..
                     C      C7            G        G7          C
Down the beach I see, what belongs to me, the one I want most of all.

CHORUS:
  G              G7              C        C7
Oh, devil woman, devil woman let go of me.
             G               G7                 C
Devil woman, let me be, and leave me alone, Iâ€™m going back home.

There is a You Tube performance of Marty Robbins performing this song. http://
youtu.be/eT88zD912Xo You can see his fourth finger rests pretty steadily on the 
3rd fret(realitive to the capo) on the E(6) string for a high G. He strums with 
his thumb and picks that high G. Sounds really nice.
