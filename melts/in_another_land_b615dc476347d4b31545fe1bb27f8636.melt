"In Another Land"
Written by Bill Wyman for the Rolling Stones
Chords by David Goodwin (ME!)
Note: As the song repeats, I'm just giving the first verse/chorus. Oh,
and thanks to www.lyrics.ch for the lyrics.

Intro: C, Bb, Ab, G
C, Bb, Ab, G

C    C7     F
In another land
          Ab             Eb        Ab
Where the breeze and the trees and flowers were blue
C           C7        F
I stood and held your hand
        Ab         Eb           Ab
And the grass grew high and the feathers floated by
Ab         D         G
I stood and held your hand
    F             C
And nobody else's hand will ever do
F                C
Nobody else will do
         D
Then I awoke
		      F
Was this some kind of joke?
	   D
Much to my surprise
            F        G
I opened my eyes


Ad naseum. Enjoy!
