Sway chords
The Rolling Stones (Jagger/Richards) 

Capo I  *

A E A B  A

E            B          A
Did you ever wake up to find, 
E          B             A
a day that broke up your mind 
E              B         A             
Destroyed your notion of circular time 

B                             A                   
It's just that demon life has got you in it s sway 
B                             A
It's just that demon life has got you in it s sway 

E              B                A
Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground; 
E          B                  A     
for all my friends out on the burial ground 
E               B               A
Can't stand the feeling getting so brought down 

B                             A
It's just that demon life has got me in it s sway 
B                             A
It's just that demon life has got me in it s sway 

A     E    A  B            A
There must be ways to find out 
A    E  A   B               A              B  A
Love is the way they say is real, starting out

A E A B  A

E    B        A
Hey, hey, hey now 

E         B          A
One day I woke up to find, 
E            B           A
right in the bed next to mine 
E            B                    A
Someone that broke me up with the corner of her smile, yeah 

B                             A
It's just that demon life has got me in it s sway 
B                             A
It's just that demon life has got me in it s sway 


B                             A
It's just that demon life has got me in it s sway 
B                             A
It's just that demon life has got me in it s sway 
B                             A
It's just that demon life has got me...
