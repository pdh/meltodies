No Hidden Path

    Em7             A        Em7           C
Sometimes when I go walkin' among the tall trees
  Em7            A              Em7 A
I feel the light comin' down on me
      Em7         A     Em7             C
Under moon, under sun I feel the chosen one
            Em7        A                 Em7 A
Through the mist, come walkin' here with me

And the leaves on the ground make a rustling sound
In the wind now blowing in my face
It's that cool wind again and I feel my missing friend
Whose counsel I can never replace

Em7         A            Em7          C     Em7  A  Em7  A
Show me the way and I'll follow you today
Show me the way and I'll follow you today

 G                                  Bm             Em7
(Show me the way) No more darkness, no more wasted time
             G                     Bm                   Em7
(Show me the way) Let me stay here with this heart of mine
C                             G
And with you I feel no hidden path
          C               G
No hidden path, no hidden path
          C               G
No hidden path No hidden path


How you change, how you change and how you rearrange
Everything that touches me
Now you're her, now you're her and she's sleeping here with me
Everything that touches me

Ocean sky, sea of blue let the sand wash over you
Giving all that you can give
Will the northern lights still play as we walk our distant days
Giving all that we can give

Show me the way and I'll follow you today
Show me the way and I'll follow you today

(Show me the way) There's a cold wind blowin' through my mind
(Show me the way) But I'm holdin' on to the threads of time
And with you I feel no hidden path
No hidden path No hidden path
No hidden path
