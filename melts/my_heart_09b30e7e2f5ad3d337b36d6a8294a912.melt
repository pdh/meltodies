	INTRO:
	F    C    F    Em    G

	F
	Down in the valley the shepherd sees
	C
	His flock is close at hand
	F                                        Em
	And in the night sky a star is falling down
	               G
	From someone\'s hand

	    C          F
	Somewhere, somewhere
	     C              F
	I\'ve got to get somewhere
	     C       F          C       F
	It\'s not too late, it\'s not too late
	     C              F
	I\'ve got to get somewhere

	     Am                   Em       F
	This time I will take the lead somehow
	     Am                     Em      G
	This time you won\'t have to show me how

	F
	When dreams come crashing down like trees
	C
	I don\'t know what love can do
	F
	When life is hanging in the breeze
	Em                          G
	I don\'t know what love can do

	   C         F
	My heart, my heart
	     C              F
	I\'ve got to keep my heart
	     C       F          C       F
	It\'s not too late, it\'s not too late
	     C              F
	I\'ve got to keep my heart

	   Am                   Em       F
	My love, I will give to you it\'s true
	  Am                       Em       G
	Although I\'m not sure what love can do

	F    C    F    Em    G

	    C          F
	Somewhere, somewhere
	     C              F
	I\'ve got to get somewhere
	     C       F          C       F
	It\'s not too late, it\'s not too late
	     C              F
	I\'ve got to get somewhere

	    Am                  Em         F
	Somewhere someone has a dream come true
	    Am                Em         G
	Somehow someone has a dream come true
