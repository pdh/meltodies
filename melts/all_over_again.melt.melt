Ev'ry time I look at you, I fall in love, all over again.
                                                                                   A
Ev'ry time I think of you, it all begins, all over again.
D
One little dream at night and I can dream all day.
        A
It only takes a memory to thrill me.
D
One little kiss from you and I just fly away.
A                                                      E
Pour me out your love until you fill me.

I want to fall in love, beginning from the start, all over again.

Show me how you stole away my heart, all over again.
