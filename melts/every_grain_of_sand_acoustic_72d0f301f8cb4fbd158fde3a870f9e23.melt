Capo I

D G 4x

       D             G               D                  G
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
         D               G             A
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
          D               G     D                G
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere
D              G                 A 
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.

      A                            D              A
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake
                                       D                 A
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
       D           G            D                G
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
   D               G            A     G        D
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.

        D               G             D              G
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
     D                    G                    A
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
    D              G                D                 G
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way 
   D                G                A
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.

  A                        D                  A
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
                                 D              A
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
     D            G         D            G
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
     D             G             A     G        D
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.

break

       D                 G             D             G
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
       D             G                      A
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light
       D               G          D           G
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
       D                G            A
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.

  A                                   D             A
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
                                               D               A
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me
     D              G              D          G
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
     D             G             A     G        D
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
