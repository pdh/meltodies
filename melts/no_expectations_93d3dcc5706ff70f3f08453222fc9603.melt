G              D
Take me to the station 
    G           D
And put me on a train 
     G             D
I've got no expectations 
   C            G     D
To pass through here again 

G            D
Once I was a rich man and 
G           D
Now I am so poor
    G           D
But never in my sweet short life 
     C           G      D
Have I felt like this before 

     G               D
Your heart is like a diamond 
    G                    D
You throw your pearls at swine 
    G              D
And as I watch you leaving me 
    C       G        D
You pack my peace of mind 

G D 3x
C G D

    G                 D
Our love was like the water 
     G             D
That splashes on a stone 
    G                D
Our love is like our music 
     C         G         D  
It s here, and then it s gone 

   G              D
So take me to the airport
    G           D
And put me on a plane 
  G           D
I got no expectations 
   C            G     D
To pass through here again 

G D 3x
C G D
