I got a woman, stay drunk all the time

A  G D
                                             A
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true

A      E               G          D
Sunday morning when we go down to church,
                             A
see the menfolks standin' in line
A              E       G           D
DonÂ´t say they come to pray to the Lord,
                                  A
but when my little girl, looks so fine
A      E                G              D
In the evening when the sun is sinkin' low,
                              A
everybody's with the one they love
A          E            F#m            D
I walk the town, keep a-searchin' all around,
                             A
lookin' for my street corner girl

A  G D
                              A
I got a woman, wanna ball all day

A  G D
                            A

A  G D
                                  A
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time

A  G D
                                             A
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true

A      E              G               D
In the bars, with the men who play guitars,
                                      A
singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times
A         E              G        D
My little lover does the midnight shift,
                           A
she fool around all of the time
A               E              G              D
I guess there's just one thing left for me to do,
                                 A
so I pack my bags and move on my way
                      E
Cause I got a worried mind,
        F#m                D 
sharin' what I thought was mine
                                  A
Gonna leave her where the guitars play


A  G D
                              A
I got a woman, wanna ball all day

A  G D
                            A
I got a woman, she won't be true, no

A  G D
                                  A
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time

A  G D
                                             A
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true

 A       G          D
(Hey hey what can I do?)
                    A
I said she won't be true
 A        G          D
(Hey Hey, what can I say?)
A        G          D
Hey hey, what can I do?
                            A
I got a woman, she won't be true
A     G           D
Lord, hear what I say
                              A
I got a woman, wanna ball all day
