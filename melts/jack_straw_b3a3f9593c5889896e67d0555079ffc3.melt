Jack Straw -- Grateful Dead (Hunter, Garcia)
 
E                F#m                     C#m  A
We can share the women, we can share the wine
 
E                 Bm                  D        A                  E   G#m  D  A
We can share what we've got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine.
 
E                F#m            C#m  A
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go,
 
E                Bm     D             A               E   B  A  E  E7
Keep on rollin', my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow.
 
Esus7             E7        Esus7             E7
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence,
 
Esus7                E7               Esus7             E7
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that heaven sent?
 
F#sus7           F#7              F#sus7           F#7
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, burns my eyes to see,
 
F#sus7            F#7                  F#sus7             D  Bm  A  E
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well been me.
 
D          Bm       A                       E
We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
 
D             Bm                  A                       E
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife.
 
D           Bm     A                        E
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall;
 
D              Bm        A         E                     A
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all,
 
         D  G  D  G  E  Esus4  E  Esus4  E
Not with all.
 
 
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July,
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky.
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe,
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne from sea to shining sea.
 
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride,
Got to settle one old score, one small point of pride.
Ain't no place a man can hide, Shannon, to keep him from the sun;
Ain't no bed can give us rest, now, you keep us on the run.
 
Jack Straw from Witchita cut his buddy down,
And dug for him a shallow grave and laid his body down.
Half a mile from Tuscon, by the morning light,
One man gone and another to go, my old buddy you're moving much too slow.
 
We can share the women, we can share the wine.
