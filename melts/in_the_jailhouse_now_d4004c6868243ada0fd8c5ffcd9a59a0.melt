Verse 1

C
I had a friend named Bill Campbell he used to rob steal and gamble
                                      F
And on the side he'd beg so he mopped up

I told him he shouldn't do it and Campbell told me he knew it
      D7                                         G
So he started beggin' with a bucket instead of a cup

 G                     C
 He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
                       F
 He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
      G
 Well Campbell fluffed his dove when he wore a tuxedo to the country club
                       C
 He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)

Verse 2
 
C
I met his old gal Sadie she said have you seen Billy lately
                                 F
I said I don't believe that he's about

She went down to the jail she went down to take him his mail
     D7                                         G
Then she whispered sheriff please don't let him out

 G                     C
 He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
                       F
 He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
       G
 While Campbell's put away Sadie's with the sheriff everyday
                       C 
 He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)

Verse 3

C
Well I remember the last election the prohibitionists were in action
                                    F
They's tryin' to elect themselves a president

Bill Canpbell and John Austin walked from New Orleans to Boston
    D7                                  G
And they've got a bottle in every settlement

 G                        C
 They're in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
                          F
 They're in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
      G
 They were down at the railroad track stealin' a train to haul it back
                          C
 They're in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
