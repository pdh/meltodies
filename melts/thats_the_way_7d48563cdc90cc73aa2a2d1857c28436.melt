Riff
     I don't know how I'm going to tell you
     I can't play with you no more  
     I don't know how I'm going to do what mama told me
     My friend the boy next door

     I can't believe what people saying
     You only let your hair down
     I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
     You're in the darkest side of town
 
     And when I'm out I see you walking
     Why don't your eyes see me
     Could it be you've found another game to play
     What did mama say to me

G6 	                            		Riff 
     That's the way   Oh  that's the way it ought to be
G6                  			 B
     Mama said that's the way it ought to stay

Riff
     And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
     And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
     And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
     Had they got you hypnotized

     And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
     But all that lives is born to die
     And so I say to you that nothing really matters
     And all you do is stand and cry

     I don't know what to say about it
     When all your ears are turned away
     But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
     Is that the way it ought to stay

G6 	                            		Riff 
     That's the way  That's the way it ought to be    Whoa don't you know now
G6                  			 		B
     Mama said  mama said that's the way it's going to stay   Ahh Ahh
