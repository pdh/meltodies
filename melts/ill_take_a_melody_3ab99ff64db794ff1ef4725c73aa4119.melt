A                           D      E                       A
I've seen the rain pouring down.  The sky was grey with a speck of blue.
A                           D      E                         A
Deep through a hole in the clouds, the sun was screaming' hey you.
A                           D        E                             A
As you ramble through your sorrow, seems like everything come out wrong.
A                           D         E                              A
I'm living in yesterday's tomorrow's, I know something's helping me along.

Forgot it for now - I'll post it later

A                      D              E
I'll take a melody and see what I can do about it.
A                       D                E
I'll take a simple C to G and feel brand new about it.
F#m    Bm            F#m          Bm        C                    Bm C Bm C
I understand why the old mission men sail along, sail along, sail along.
D                 E        
Someday he'll be gone

A                               D        E                              A
I hear you talking' 'bout your troubles. Everybody's got their troubles 
too.
A                              D      E                       A
You can make them burst like clouds, if you know just what to do.
A                              D     E                            A
You know I've been called a dreamer. Dreams that never will come true.
A                             D               E                      A
But I've been called so many things before.  Tell you what I'm gonna do.
