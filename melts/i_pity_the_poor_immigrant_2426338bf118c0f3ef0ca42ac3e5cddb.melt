"I PITY THE POOR IMMIGRANT"
by BOB DYLAN
from John Wesley Harding - 1967

NOTES:
- The V7 works just fine for the third chord (AM) but in the recording I hear a clean major.

- I indicated the lyric syllable each chord change occurs on to the nearest beat, though 
occasional Dylan's phrasing is slightly different; I've notated for clarity.

- The previous chord tab for this song mysteriously left out the G after the F#m in the 
second half of the verse, but here it's present and thus order is restored to the universe.


(Capo 3rd fret)
Key of D major

INTRO:
D, G, A, D  (x2)

VERSE 1:
  D             G
I pity the poor immigrant
    A                         D
Who wishes he would've stayed home
                          G
Who uses all his power to do evil
           A                     D
But in the end is always left so alone
     Bm                F#m
That man whom with his fingers cheats
         G               D
And whom lies with every breath
                 G
Who passionately hates his life
    A                  D
And likewise fears his death


HARMONICA 1:
D, G, A, D

VERSE 2:
  D             G
I pity the poor immigrant
      A                    D
Whose strength is spent in vain
                     G
Whose heaven is like Ironsides
      A              D
Whose tears are like rain
    Bm              F#m
Who eats but is not satisfied
    G                  D
Who hears but does not see
                       G
Who falls in love with wealth itself
    A                 D
And turns his back on me


HARMONICA 2:
D, G, A, D

VERSE 3:
  D             G
I pity the poor immigrant
    A                    D
Who tramples through the mud
                         G
Who fills his mouth with laughing
        A                    D
And who builds his town with blood
      Bm             F#m
Whose visions in the final end
     G                D
Must shatter like the glass
                G
I pity the poor immigrant
          A                D
When his gladness comes to pass
