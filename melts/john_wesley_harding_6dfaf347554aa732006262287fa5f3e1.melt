Intro: D
D
 John Wesley Harding
                      A
Was a friend to the poor,
D  
He trav'led with a gun in ev'ry hand.
                   A
All along this countryside,
E
He opened a many a door,
A
But he was never known
D
To hurt an honest man.

intro

D
'Twas down in Chaynee County,
                  A
A time they talk about,
D
With his lady by his side
              A
He took a stand.

And soon the situation there
E
Was all but straightened out,
A
For he was always known
D
To lend a helping hand.


intro
D
All across the telegraph
                  A
His name it did resound,
D
But no charge held against him
             A
Could they prove.

And there was no man around
E
Who could track or chain him down,
A
He was never known
D
To make a foolish move.


Finish off with solo.
