BLACK DIAMOND BAY


Em
Up on the white veranda
C                           G
She wears a neck tie and a panama hat
Em
Her passport shows her face from
C                                 G
Another time and place she looks nothing like that
D
And all of the remnants of her
C   D    C   Em   G
Recent past are scattered in the wild wind
D
She walks across the marble floor where a
C      D        C        Em      G
Voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
     Em                     Am
She smiles walks the other way
        C    D    C     Em      Am         C
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
      C     Am7 Am  G         C Am7 Am G
From Black Diamond Bay



Em
As the morning light breaks open
C                           G
The Greek walks down and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
Em
Pardon monsieur the Desk Clerk says
C                                 G
Carefully removes his fez, am I hearing you right
D
And as the yellow fog is lifting
C   D     C  Em      G
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
D
She passes him on the spiral staircase
C      D        C        Em      G
Thinking he's the Soviet ambassador
     Em                     Am
She starts to speak but he walks away
        C    D    C     Em      Am         C
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
      C     Am7 Am  G         C Am7 Am G
On Black Diamond Bay



Em
A Soldier sits beneath the fan doing
C                           G
Business with the Tiny Man who sells him a ring
Em
Lightning strikes the lights blow out
C                                 G
The Desk Clerk wakes he begins to shout can you see anything
D
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his
C   D     C  Em      G
Barefeet with a rope around his neck
D
While the loser in the gambling room
C      D        C        Em      G
Lights up a candle says open up another deck
     Em                     Am
But the dealer says attendez-vous sil vous plait
        C    D    C     Em      Am         C
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
      C     Am7 Am  G         C Am7 Am G
From Black Diamond Bay



Em
The Desk Clerk heard the Woman laugh as he
C                           G
Looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough
Em
He tried to grab the Woman's hand
C                                 G
Said here's a ring it cost a grand she said that ain't enough
D
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a
C   D     C  Em      G
Horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
D
She passed the door that the Greek had locked where a
C      D        C        Em      G
Hand-written sign read Do not disturb
    Em                     Am
She knocked upon it anyway
        C    D    C     Em      Am         C
As the sun went down and the music did play
      C     Am7 Am  G         C Am7 Am G
On Black Diamond Bay



Em
I've got talk to someone quick but the
C                           G
Greek said go away and kicked the chair to the floor
Em
He hung there from the chandelier she
C                                 G
Cried help there's danger near please open up the door
D
Then the volcano erupted and the
C   D     C  Em      G
Lava flowed down from the mountain high above
D
The Soldier and the Tiny Man were
C      D        C        Em      G
Crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love
     Em                     Am
The Desk Clerk says it happens every day
        C    D    C     Em      Am         C
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
      C     Am7 Am  G         C Am7 Am G
On Black Diamond Bay



Em
As the island slowly sank the
C                           G
Loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
Em
The dealer said it's too late now you can
C                                 G
Take your money but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb
D
The Tiny Man bit the Soldier's ear as the
C   D     C  Em      G
Floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
D
While she's out on the balcony where a
C      D        C        Em      G
Stranger tells her my darling je vous aime beaucoup
     Em                     Am
She sheds a tear then begins to pray
        C    D    C     Em      Am         C
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
      C     Am7 Am  G         C Am7 Am G
On Black Diamond Bay



Em
I was sitting home alone one night in
C                           G
LA watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news
Em
It seems there was an earthquake there
C                                 G
Left nothing but a panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes
D
Didn't seem like much was happening so I
C   D     C  Em      G
Turned it off and went to grab another beer
D
Seems like every time you turn around there's
C      D        C        Em      G
Another hard luck story that you're gonna hear
     Em                     Am
And there's really nothing anyone can say
        C    D    C     Em      Am         C
And I never did plan to go anyway
      C     Am7 Am  G         C Am7 Am G
To Black Diamond Bay
