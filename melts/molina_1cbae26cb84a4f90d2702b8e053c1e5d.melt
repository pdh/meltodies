Moli-i-i-i-na, where you goin' to ?


D
She's daughter to the mayor

Messin' with the sheriff

Drivin' in a blue car

She don't see no red light



D
She's comin' in the mornin'

Lookin' a disaster

Drivin' in the prowl car

Spent the night in jail

D
Sheriff gonna go far

Drivin' to the state house

If she makes a million

Papa can retire
