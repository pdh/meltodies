CHORUS
         C                      F
Will you visit my grave little darling
      G                             C
Every day when the twilight shadows fall
          C                             F
Will you plant some pretty flowers all around me
        G                   C
Or will you ever miss me at all


VERSE 1
         G                           C
Will you share a little time with me darling
          G                D          G
Though my face here you'll never see anymore
       D                    G
But my spirit will wait for darling
         D                          G
Till we meet again on God's golden shore


(CHORUS)


VERSE 2
Soon the time will come when I'll be leaving
And these parting words are breaking my heart
But my leaving is only temporary
Soon we'll meet again and never have to part


(CHORUS)
