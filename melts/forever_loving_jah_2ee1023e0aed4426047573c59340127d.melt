 Wo-o-o-o! Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya,
    F#m             Bm                      C#7
Woy-oy! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Chorus 1:

F#m                       Bm  C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah,
F#m                      Bm   C#7
 We'll be forever loving Jah!)

Verse 1:

              F#m               Bm            C#7
Some they say see them, walking up the street;
               F#m                     Bm            C#7
They say we're going wrong, to all the people we meet.
               F#m             Bm            C#7
But-a we won't worry, we won't shed no tears,
           F#m            Bm                 C#7
We found a way, to cast a-way the fears, for-ever, yeah.

Chorus 2:

F#m                       Bm                 C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah), we'll be for-ever!
F#m                       Bm             C#7         (F#m)
 (We'll be forever loving Jah), forever, yes, and for-ever!
F#m                       Bm                       C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah), there'll be no end.

Verse 2:

            F#m          Bm         C#7
So, Old Man River, don't cry for me;
           F#m                        Bm   C#7
I've got a running stream of love you see.
                   F#m        Bm      C#7
So, no matter what stages, oh stages, stages,
            F#m                            Bm   C#7
Stages they put us through, we'll never be blue.
               F#m       Bm     C#7
No matter what rages, oh rages,  changes,
           F#m
Rages they put us through,
               Bm                 C#7
We'll never be blue: we'll be for-ever, yeah!

F#m                       Bm                 C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah), forever, and ever!
F#m                       Bm                   C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah), there's no end.

Verse 3:

            F#m   Bm         C#7
'Cos only a fool, lean upon, lean upon,
            F#m               Bm           C#7
His own mis-understanding, oh ho, oh, yeah!
                       F#m              Bm                   C#7
And then what has been hidden, from the wise and the prudent,
                     F#m
Been revealed to the babes and the suckling,
         Bm            C#7
In every day, in every way, I say, yeah!

Chorus 4:

F#m                       Bm                 C#7

 (We'll be forever loving Jah).

Verse 4:

                 F#m   Bm
'Cos just like a tree, planted,
C#7                       F#m
 Planted by the rivers of water,
                    Bm     C#7
That bringeth forth fruits, bringeth forth fruits.
       F#m                   Bm                   C#7
In due season; everything in life got its purpose,
         F#m             Bm          C#7
Find its reason in every season, for-ever, yeah!

Chorus 4:

F#m                       Bm                 C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah), we'll be for-ever!
F#m                       Bm                  C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah), on and on and on.
F#m                       Bm   C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah),
F#m                       Bm   C#7
 (We'll be forever loving Jah).
