Missie How You Let Me Down 
By Richard Thompson from Daring Adventures

Chords by paul@koval.freeserve.co.uk

Em7                                  D   
Hailstones and a sickle moon and the north wind races
Em7                                    D 
One more night of running my mind over lost embraces
Em7                                           
The steps you made when you walked away
D                          G     
Still frozen in the ground
G                 A      G   
Oh missie how you let me down
G                 A      G
Oh missie how you let me down
G                 A      Bm
Oh missie how you let me down
Em7                     A
And lies won't break my fall
Em7                 G
Lies won't break my fall

Em7                                     D
Your food's still sitting there at the table where you used to be
Em7                                     D
The shape of you is still in the bed there next to me
Em7                     D                               G
Maybe I could find some trace of you to keep around
G                 A       G     
Oh missie how you let me down
G                 A       Bm                    
Oh missie how you let me down

A                                      F#m
For far too long you kept me waiting
                                     G
Reaching out into empty air
A                                       F#m
Even now you'd never say it face to face
         G
That you really don't care
       A
And if you never liked pulling teeth
     D                              G                 Bm
Then why, why did you tie me in the dentist's chair
Em
Em7                                     D       
Ah you left your mark on this old place, that you did
Em7                                     D
I could stew in here like a pressure cooker and screw down the lid
Em7
Or maybe I should just take a match
D                               G
And burn the whole thing to the ground

G               A        G      
Oh missie how you let me down
G               A       G       
Oh missie how you let me down
G               A       Bm
Oh missie how you let me down
Em7                     A
And lies won't break my fall

Em7             G       
Lies won't break my fall
