VERSE 1:
C                                  B
When the rain is blowing in your face
A                           F
And the whole world is on your case
Fm                      G/C
I would offer you a warm embrace
D7              G7       C
To make you feel my love.

VERSE 2:
C                                            B
When evening shadows and the stars appear
  A                             F
And there is no one there to dry your tears
Fm                           G/C
I could hold you for a million years
D7              G7       C
To make you feel my love.

BRIDGE 1:
F                                    G/C
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
E                F                  G/C
But I would never do you wrong.
F                                   G/C
I've known it from the moment that we met
D7                                             G7  
No doubt in my mind where you belong

VERSE 3:
C                             B
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
A                               F
I'd go crawling down the avenue.
Fm                            G/C
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
D7                G7       C
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rollin' sea.
E                F              G/C
And on the highway of regret
F                                    G/C
The winds of change are blowing wild and free.
D7                                         G7         G/C
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

VERSE 4:

Thereâ€™s nothing that I would not do.

Go to the ends of the earth for you
D7            G7       G/C
To make you feel my love.
A                          F
