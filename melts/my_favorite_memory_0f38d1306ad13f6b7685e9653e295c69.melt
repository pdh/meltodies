Saw this song played... I had a hard time figuring out how to put together the other 
this is the easiest way to play it and it sounds pretty close to the way Merle Haggard 
it... anyways please comment... enjoy...

Also you can put a capo on if you need... I use a capo to my voice... if you use a capo 
chords are the same... or in other words you play it the same as if there were no capo...

D                    D7                        G
The first time we met is a favorite mem'ry of mine.
A
They say time changes all it pertains to
                                   D
But your memory is stronger than time.
D                              D7                           G
I guess everything does change except what you choose to recall.
A
There's a million good daydreams to dream on
 					                                        D
But, baby, you are My Favorite Mem'ry of all.
D                                    D7
Like the night we made love in the hallway,
                             G
Slept all night long on the floor.
A						                                        D
Like the winter we spent at Lake Shasta alone, and closer than ever before.
D		                               D7
And I remember that London vacation.
				                                        G
It was you who made the whole thing a ball.
A
There's a million good-times I could dwell on,

                                          D
But, baby, you are My Favorite Mem'ry of all.
A                      D
My Favorite Memory of all
