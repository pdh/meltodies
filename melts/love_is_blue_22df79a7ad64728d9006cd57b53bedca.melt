D     G        C        F
Blue, blue, my world is blue..
Dm         Bb          C           F
blue is my world since I'm without you.

D    G       C        F    Dm
Red, red, my eyes are red..crying for 
Bb   C          F
you alone in my bed.
Dm     G         C       F      Dm
Green, green, my jealous heart..I doubted

you and now we're apart.

When we met..how the bright sun shone.
Gbm       G             A          Dm
Then love died..now the rainbow is gone.
