Sugar Mountain chords  (live version)
Neil Young *

D C G F D Dsus4 C  G

G              F
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain,
G                        F
with the barkers and the colored balloons
G                   F
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain,
Dm                                                   G
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon;
Dm                       G
you're leaving there too soon.

G                    F
It's so noisy at the fair, 
                         G
but all your friends are there
                        F
And the candy floss you had,
                         G
and your mother and your dad.

G              F
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain,
G                        F
with the barkers and the colored balloons
G                   F
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain,
Dm                                                   G
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon;
Dm                       G
you're leaving there too soon.

D C G F D Dsus4 C  G

G                            F
There's a girl just down the aisle,
                        G
oh, to turn and see her smile.
                           F
You can hear the words she wrote,
                       G
as you read the hidden note.

G              F
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
G                        F
with the barkers and the colored balloons
G                   F
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain,
Dm                                                   G
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon;
Dm                       G
you're leaving there too soon.

D C G F D Dsus4 C  G

G                         F
Now you're underneath the stairs, 
                            G
and you're giving back some glares
                      F
To the people who you met,
                        G   
and it's your first cigarette.

G              F
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain,
G                        F
with the barkers and the colored balloons
G                   F
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain,
Dm                                                   G
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon;
Dm                       G
you're leaving there too soon.

G                             F
Now you say you're leaving home,
                       G
'cause you want to be alone.
                       F
Ain't it funny how you feel,
                             G
when you're finding out it's real?

G              F
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain,
G                        F
with the barkers and the colored balloons
G                   F
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain,
Dm                                                   G
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon;
Dm                       G
you're leaving there too soon.

G              F
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain,
G                        F
with the barkers and the colored balloons
G                   F
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain,
Dm                                                   G
though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
