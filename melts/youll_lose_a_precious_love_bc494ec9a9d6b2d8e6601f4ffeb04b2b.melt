Was listening to this song and was wondering how it would sound on guitar! Picked out 
chords so here there are, the middle eight is a bit rough, couldn't really figure it out 
but it's mighty close.

YOU'LL LOSE A PRECIOUS LOVE
WRITER WILLIAM "SMOKEY" ROBINSON

Intro:

C, D#, the next two chords are in the form of an open D but played on the 5th and then 
frets (D# is played like an open D on the 3rd fret, so you just move down 3-5-7... easy! 
only hit the three bottom strings aka G, B, and E])


    C             D#           C
One Day, You will begin to realize
       D#                C
by the look that’s in my eyes
           Am
How much I love you (Love You)
           D7           G               C      (REPEAT INTRO)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love (You'll Lose A Precious Love)

    C                  D#                C
Somehow, these arms of mine cant let you go
                D#                       C
The touch of my hand baby should let you know
           AM
How much I love you (Love You)
           D7           G               C       (REAPEAT INTRO)
And If you leave you'll lose a precious love (You'll Lose A Precious Love)
C     D             G        C
We go together like hand and glove
D                 G
Don’t Destroy our precious love
    C                 D#                C
Somehow these arms of mine cant let you go
                D#                  C
the touch of my hand should let you know
           AM
How much I love you (Love You)
           D7           G               C       (REAPEAT INTRO)
And If you leave you'll lose a precious love (You'll Lose A Precious Love)
