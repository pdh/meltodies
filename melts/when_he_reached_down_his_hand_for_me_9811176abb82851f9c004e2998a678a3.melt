C                                G7       C
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way 
                   G7            C
I was wretched and vile as could be 
                      F                  C
But my Savior in love gave me peace from above 
                     G7           C
When he reached down his hand for me 
 
                         F        C
When he reached down his hand for me 
                             G7
When he reached way down for me 
      C               F                     C
I was lost and undone without my God or his Son 
                     G7           C
When he reached down his hand for me 
 
                              G7         C
I was near to despair when he came to me there 
                      G7         C
And he showed me that I could be free 
                       F                C
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete 
                     G7           C
When he reached down his hand for me
