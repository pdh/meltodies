                     SWEETHEARTS TOGETHER
                       ROLLING  STONES


INTRO:   G  C -- 2x's

CHORUS:
      G
       Sweethearts together
             C
       We've only just begun
      G
       Sweethearts together
              C
       We'll take life as it comes
      G
       Sweethearts forever
      C              D         G     D  G  D
       Two hearts together as one


VERSE:
        G                          C
       Everybody needs someone to tell their troubles to
            G
       To share the pain and laughter
              C
       In a world beset with fools
           G
       To help you with your ups and downs
          C
       Someone to heal your wounds


CHORUS:
       So we're sweethearts together
       When two hearts beat as one
       Sweethearts together
       We've only just begun
       Sweethearts forever
       Two hearts together as one
       As one

VERSE:
       Everyone so cynical and says that love won't last
       Think about your future stop living in the past
       Time's not standing still
       So stop looking through those tinted glasses

CHORUS:
       Sweethearts together we've only just begun
       Sweethearts together
       So glad I found someone
       Sweethearts forever
       Two hearts together as one
       As one


INSTRUMENTAL:   PLAY CHORDS TO CHORUS


VERSE:
       But love is never easy
       It's never silky smooth
       There's always something tempting
       In the wilderness of youth
       But I will stay right by your side
       The truth will out, you'll realise
       We're

CHORUS:
       Sweethearts together we've only just begun
       Sweethearts together
       So glad I found someone
       Sweethearts forever
       Two hearts together as one
