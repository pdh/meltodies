Transcribed by Dan Nicholas

G                                  Am
Come over to the window my little darling

C                             G
I'd like to try to read your palm

F                                   C
I used to think I was some kind of gypsy boy

 Em                       D     D7
Before I let you take me home

          G                       Em
Cho...Now so long Marianne  it's time we began

          D                         D7            G
      To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again


G                            Am
Well you know that I love to live with you

C                               G
But you make me forget so very much

F                         C
I forget to pray for the angels

Em                                     D      D7
And then the angels forget to pray for us

Cho...

G                   Am
We met when we were almost young

C                        G
Deep in the green Lilac park

F                               C
You held on to me like I was a crucifix

Em                            D    D7
As we went kneeling thru the dark


Cho...
