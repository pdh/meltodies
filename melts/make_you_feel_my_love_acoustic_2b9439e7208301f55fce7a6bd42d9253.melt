Make You Feel My Love chords for acoustic guitar
Bob Dylan 1997

Capo III*

A E  G D  Dm A  B7 D A

A                        E            G
When the rain is blowin' in your face
                       D            Dm
And the whole world is on your case
                    A           B7
I could offer you a warm embrace
            D       A
To make you feel my love.

A                                E            G
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
            D              Dm
And there is no one there to dry your tears
                       A            B7
I could hold you for a million years
            D       A
To make you feel my love.

D                            A          A7
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
            D            A     A7
But I would never do you wrong
D                             A          B7
I've known it from the moment that we met
                          E          E7
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

A                     E             G
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
                         D      Dm
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
                           A           B7
No, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
            D       A
To make you feel my love.

break

D                            A           A7
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
           D            A    A7
And on the highway of regrets
D                               A            B7
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
                            E      E7
You ain't seen nothin' like me yet.

A                                 E                G
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
                       D          Dm
There's nothing that I wouldn t do
                      A            B7     
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
            D       A
To make you feel my love.
