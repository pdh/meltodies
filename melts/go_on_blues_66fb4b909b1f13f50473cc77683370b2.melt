-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tabbed by: Captain Ben
This is a beautiful and easy song.

Tuning: Standard

E                  A
 Go on blues go on lonesome
          B                  E
 get your dark clouds off of me
E                  A
 Go on blues go on trouble
           B              E
 stay away from me set me free

           A                        D
 I've been down through that valley with you
            F#                        B
 and now if you would just go on then I could go on too
E                     A
 Go on blues get away from me
       B           E
 go on by me go on blues
