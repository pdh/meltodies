A7
Johnnys in the basement

Mixing up the medicine

Im on the pavement

Thinking about the government

The man in the trench coat

Badge out, laid off

Says hes got a bad cough

Wants to get it paid off

D7
Look out kid

Its somethin you did
A7
God knows when

But youre doin it again

You better duck down the alley way

Lookin for a new friend
E7
The man in the coon-skin cap

In the big pen

Wants eleven dollar bills

You only got ten


A7
Maggie comes fleet foot

Face full of black soot

Talkin that the heat put

Plants in the bed but

The phones tapped anyway

Maggie says that many say

They must bust in early may

Orders from the d. a.
D7
Look out kid

Dont matter what you did
A7
Walk on your tip toes

Dont try no doz

Better stay away from those

That carry around a fire hose

Keep a clean nose

Watch the plain clothes
E7
You dont need a weather man

To know which way the wind blows


A7
Get sick, get well

Hang around a ink well

Ring bell, hard to tell

If anything is goin to sell

Try hard, get barred

Get back, write braille

Get jailed, jump bail

Join the army, if you fail
D7
Look out kid

Youre gonna get hit
A7
But losers, cheaters

Six-time users

Hang around the theaters

Girl by the whirlpool

Lookin for a new fool
E7
Dont follow leaders

Watch the parkin meters


A7
Ah get born, keep warm

Short pants, romance, learn to dance

Get dressed, get blessed

Try to be a success

Please her, please him, buy gifts

Dont steal, dont lift

Twenty years of schoolin

And they put you on the day shift
D7
Look out kid

They keep it all hid
A7
Better jump down a manhole

Light yourself a candle

Dont wear sandals

Try to avoid the scandals

Dont wanna be a bum

You better chew gum
E7
The pump dont work

cause the vandals took the handles



Hope this helped.
