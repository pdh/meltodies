THE END OF THE RAINBOW
Richard Thompson
Transcribed bu Phil Saunders
(Capo 3rd fret, recorded in Cm, transcribed in Am)
The C(?) doesn't sound quite right, corrections welcomed.

           Am              F
I feel for you, you little horror
     Dm               G
Safe at your mother's breast
   Dm    Am        F              G
No lucky break for you around the corner
            Am          F
'Cause your father is a bully
       Dm                   G
And he thinks that you're a pest
         C(?)   F        C             Am
And your sister she's no better than a whore.

Dm   Am       F           G
Life seems so rosy in the cradle,
         Am   G           F                  G
But I'll be a friend I'll tell you what's in store
        Dm      Am     F          G
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow.
        Am      G       F         G
There's nothing to grow up for anymore

Tycoons and barrow boys will rob you
And throw you on the side
And all because they love themselves sincerely
And the man hold a bread knife
Up to you throat it's four feet wide
And he's anxious just to show you what it's for.

Your mother works so hard to make you happy
But take a look outside your nursery door
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow.
There's nothing to grow up for anymore

All the sad and empty faces
That pass you in the street
All running in their sleep, all in a dream
Every loving handshake
Is just another man to beat
How your heart aches just to cut hiom to the core

Life seems so rosy in the cradle,
But I'll be a friend I'll tell you what's in store
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow.
There's nothing to grow up for anymore
