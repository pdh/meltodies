(intro 2x) C A Dm G

C            E                 A                  A7
We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when
       D                D7              G     G7
but I know we'll meet again some sunny day.
C         E                   A          A7
Keep smiling through just like you always do,
          D                  D7          G     C      F C
till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away.
             C7         C             C7           C
And will you please say hello to the folks that I know
F
tell 'em I won't be long,
                 D         D7          D        D7
and they'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
     G                   G7
I was singing this song.
