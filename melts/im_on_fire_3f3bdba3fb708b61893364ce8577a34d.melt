I'M ON FIRE  (Johnny Cash, Tribute to Bruce Springsteen)    [AL#13]
 
    A
Hey little girl is your daddy home
                                     D/F#
Did he go away and leave you all alone
             F#m
I got a bad desire
Dsus2  E        A
Ooh_____ I'm on fire


Tell me now baby is he good to you
                                       D/F#
Can he do to you the things that I do oh no
               F#m
I can take you higher
Dsus2  E        A
Ooh_____ I'm on fire

  4x    4x   4x   3x

It's like someone took a knife baby edgy and dull 
                                                         A
and cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull

       A
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet

and a freight train running through the middle of my head
     D/F#                F#m
Only you...can cool my desire
Dsus2  E        A     Dsus2   E       A     Dsus2   E       A
Ooh_____ I'm on fire, Ooh_____ I'm on fire, Ooh_____ I'm on fire
