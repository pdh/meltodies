Here's To You     Joan Baez   Composed by Ennio Morricone  1971

C         G/B    Am       G
Here's to you, Nicola and Bart

C       G/B    Am          G
Rest forever   here in our hearts

    Em       Dm    G/B       C
The last and final moment is yours

C    Am Dm     E       Am
That ag-ony is your triumph
