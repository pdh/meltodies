Child Of The Moon chords
The Rolling Stones

Dsus4 D x6

    D    G               D  G   
The wind blows rain into my face 
    D   G                       D   G   
The sun glows at the end of the highway 
A                                 G  D
Child of the moon, rub your rainy eyes 
A
Oh, child of the moon 
          G          F#m             A
Give me a wide awake crescent shaped smile 

Dsus4 D x4

    D   G                        D  G   
She shivers, by the light she is hidden 
    D    G                    D  G   
She flickers like a lamp lady vision 
A                                 G  D
Child of the moon, rub your rainy eyes 
A
Oh, child of the moon 
          G          F#m             A
Give me a wide awake crescent shaped smile 

Dsus4 D x2

    D     G                     D  G   
The first car on the foggy road riding 
    D    G                   D  G   
The last star for my lady is pining 
    A                               G  D
Oh, child of the moon, bid the sun arise 
A                                 G  D
Child of the moon, rub your rainy eyes 
A
Oh, child of the moon 
          G          F#m             A  G A D
Give me a wide awake crescent shaped smile
