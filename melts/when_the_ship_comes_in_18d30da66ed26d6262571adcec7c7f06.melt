       G              Bm
Oh the time will come up
         C          G
when the winds will stop
        Em          Bm          G
and the breeze will cease to be breathin'
                          Bm
like the stillness in the wind
           C           G
before the hurricane begins
                  D7         G
The hour when the ship comes in

Chorus:
        Bm
Oh the seas will split 
         C        G
and the ship will hit
        Bm                             G
and the sands on the shoreline will be shakin'
         Bm
Then the tide will sound
        C         G
And the wind will pound
                C/G  G  D7 Am7 G    C/G G
and the morning will be brea-a-kin'.


Oh the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in
 
And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean
 
A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in
 
Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'
 
Oh the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that it's for real
The hour when the ship comes in
 
Then they'll raise their hands
Sayin' we'll meet all your demands
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered
And like Pharoah's tribe
 They'll be drownded in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered
