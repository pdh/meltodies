Who ever tabbed out the first version of this was WAY! off
Here is a better version at least you can play these chords with the song.


A#
My daddy left home when I was three
       Eb
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
                                           Fb
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
A#
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
        Eb
But the meanest thing that he ever did
      Fb                                   A#
Was before he left, he went and named me 'Sue.'
 
A#     Eb      Fb

E-1   E-6     E-8
B-3   B-8     B-10
G-3   G-8     G-10
D-3   D-8     D-10
A-1   A-6     A-8
