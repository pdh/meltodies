If anyone has corrections or knows how to play Slipknot, I'd
love to hear from you.  Unfortunately, I'm losing net access

This is how I hear it....

                                                    (A)       (Em)
   Paradise waits....  on the crest of a wave, her angels in flame.

                                   2nd time:      |--------------------|

                                                    (A)       (Em)
   She has no pain...  like a child she's pure, she is not to blame.


 Chorus:
         Em         F#m       Em           F#m         
(high E) |----------------0 2|-------------------0 2 3|
         Poised for flight    Wings spread bright      

         Am          Bm       (Bm?)       Em
         |-------------------|------------------------|
                             |------------------------|
                             |------------------------|

                             |----------------------10|
         Spring from night into the sun.


 Verse: (similar patterns)
   Em                  Bm                         A            Em
   Don't stop to run.  She can fly like a lie she can't be out done.
   Tell me the cost.   I can pay, let me go(?), tell me love is not lost.
   Sell everything.    Without love in the dream, insanities king(?).

 Chorus:
   Em     F#m     Em     F#m    Am   Bm   (Bm?)         Em
   I will pay,    Day by day,   anyway,   lock bolt and key.

 Verse:
   Em                  Bm                          A           Em
   Crippled but free,  I was blind all the time, I was learning to see.

 Cool Jam (I think it follows the verse pretty close)

   Help on the Way.   Well I know all of this, I got ya today.
   Don't fly away.    Cause I love what I love and I want it that way.

 Chorus:
   Em     F#m     Em     F#m     Am   Bm   (Bm?)        Em
   I will stay,   one more day,  like I say, honey it's you.

 Verse:
   Em                  Bm                        A              Em
   Makin it too,       Without love in the dream, it'll never come true.


Then it starts Slipknot about here....
  Em
