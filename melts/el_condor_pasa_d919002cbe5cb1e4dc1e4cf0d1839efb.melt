EL CONDOR PASA (IF I COULD)
written by Robles/Milchberg/Simon
performed by Simon and Garfunkel
tab transcribed by Collins Crapo 

                               G
I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
                                  Em
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
Hmm-mmmmm

Verse 2:
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
Hmm-mmmmm

Bridge:
 C
Away, I'd rather sail away
       G
Like a swan that's here and gone
  C
A man gets tied up to the ground
             G
He gives the world it's saddest sound
             Em
It's saddest sound, hmm-mmmmm

Verse 3:
I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would

Verse 4:
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would

(repeat bridge as instrumental, fade out)
