       Eb      
Oh, Carol 
                                Bb
Don't let him steal your heart away 
F    
I'm gonna learn to dance 
      Eb                     Bb
If it takes me all night and day 

Bb
Climb into my machine so we can groove on out 
I know some swinging little joint where we can jump and shout 
Eb                                            
It's not too far back on the highway not so long a ride 
Bb
You park the car out in the open you can walk inside 
F
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am 
Bb
'Cause every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed 

Repeat intro

Oh, Carol 
Don't let him steal your heart away 
I'm gonna learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day 

Repeat intro

Guitarsolo

Now, if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing 
Hold tight, bang your foot don't let it carry you away 
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud 
Won't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd 
Well you can't dance I know you would you could 
I got my eyes on you, baby, cause you dance so good 

Repeat intro

Oh, Carol 
Don't let him steal your heart away 
I'm gonna learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day 

Repeat intro

Oh, Carol 
Don't let him steal your heart away 
I've got to learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day 

Ok, that's it. 
For the fills and solo you can use the 
Bb minor pentatonic. It's pretty basic.
