Harmonica intro.  Play C throughout 

   C/Em     C   G
I've been a moonshiner,
    G              D      
For seventeen long years,
     Em        C  G
I've spent all my money,
   G           C
On whiskey and beer,
  C          D
I go to some hollow,
    G         C
And sit at my still
       Em      C    G
And if whiskey dont kill me,
       G         C    D
Then I dont know what will,

Harmonica Break,  Play Progression Thourought (Em,C,G,G,C,D)

C/Em    C    G 
I go to some bar room,
    G             D
And drink with my friends,
          Em    C    G
Where the women cant follow,
    G          C
And see what I spend,
    C                 D
God bless them pretty women,
  G             C
I wish they was mine,
    C/Em        C  G 
Their breath is as sweet as,
    G          D
The dew on the vine,

Harmonica Break,  Play chord progression thoughout (Em,C,G,G,C,D)

       Em       C   G
Let me eat when I'm hungry,
       G               D
Let me drink when I am dry,
  Em          C   G
A dollar when I'm hard up,
    G               C
And religion when I die,
    C               D
The whole world's a bottle,
    G            C
And life's but a dram,
         Em     C    G
When the bottle gets empty,
   G                  C
It sure ain't worth a damn.

Harmonica Break,  Play Progression Throughout with feeling. (Em,C,G,G,C,D)
