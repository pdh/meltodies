HOLDING THINGS TOGETHER
Words and music by Merle Haggard

CHORUS
CAPO: 1st FRET  KEY: Bb  PLAY: A
[A] HOLDING [E] THINGS [A] TOGETHER
Ain't no easy [A7] thing to [D] do
When it comes to raisin' [A] children
It's a job - meant for [E] two
[A] Alice [E] please be-[A]lieve me
I can't go [A7] on and [D] on
Holding things [A] together [E]
With you [A] gone.

Today was [E] Angie's [A] birthday
I guess it [A7] slipped your [D] mind
I tried twice to [A] call you
But no answer either [E] time
But the [A] postman [E] brought a [A] present
I mailed some [A7]  days [D] ago
I just signed it love from [A] mama
So [E] Angie wouldn't [A] know.

CHORUS

Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together
With you gone.
