*Released 1959*


Chorus 1:

G (n.C)             C
 Everybody loves to cha cha cha,
                        G
Little children like to cha cha cha.
             D7                        C
They like to cha cha cha, they like to cha cha cha. Ooh!
G (n.C)             C       G
 Everybody loves to cha cha cha.

Verse 1:

G
 Took my baby to the hop last night,
                    D7
And what, to my sur-prise.
                       C
When we got there, she hit me with the news,
D7                 G6
 Right between the eyes, yeah.

Chorus 2:

    G                        C
She said she couldn't do the cha cha cha,
                             G
She said she couldn't do the cha cha cha.
              D7                             C
She couldn't (cha cha cha), no, she couldn't cha cha cha.
G (n.C)                  C       G
 My baby couldn't do the cha cha cha.

Verse 2:

G                                                D7
 I told her not to worry; they'd play some other dance.
                        C
But we sat there for an hour and a half,
       D7          G6
And we never got a chance. For...

Chorus 3:

G                               C
 Every song they played was the cha cha cha,
                               G
Every song they played was the cha cha cha.
              D7                          C
"Tom Dooley", cha cha cha, "Tea For Two", cha cha cha, ooh!
G (n.C)               C       G
 Every number was the cha cha cha.

Verse 3:

G                                                       D7
 I told her not to worry; there's only one thing we can do.
                    C
Baby, if you let me take you by the hand,
          D7                  G6
I'm gonna teach this dance to you. Then, I taught her;

Bridge 1:

G                      C
 One two, cha cha cha, one two, cha cha cha,
    G               C
And up now, take it back, now.
              D7                       C
That's right, turn now, alright, let's cross now, ooh!
G (n.C)                  C       G
 I taught my baby how to cha cha cha.

Verse 4:

G                                                 D7
 We kept on dancing, and was I surprised, for you see;
                            C
After we practiced it for a little while,
        D7                   G6
She was doing it better than me. Now...

Chorus 4:

   G                    C
My baby loves to do the cha cha cha,
                    G
She loves to do the cha cha cha.
               D7                              C
She likes her (cha cha cha), ooh, she likes to cha cha cha, ooh!
G (n.C)             C       G
 Everybody likes to cha cha cha. They do it...

Coda:

G                              C
 One two, cha cha cha, alright, one two, cha cha cha.
    G               C
And up now, alright back now.
                   G                   C
Alright baby let's cross now, mmm, and turn now.
     G                   C
Woah-oh-oh-oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh.

(Fade)
