This is my way of playing the song. It's pretty easy.

[C]Once upon a time you[Dm7] dressed so fine
You[Em] threw the bums a dime[F] in your prime,[G] didn't you?
[C]People'd call, say, "[Dm7]Beware doll, you're[Em] bound to fall"
You thought [F]they were all[G]kiddin' you
[F]You used to[G] laugh about
[F]Everybody that was[G] hangin' out
[F]Now you[C] don't[Dm7] talk so[C] loud
[F]Now you[C] don't[Dm7] seem so[C] proud
A[Dm]bout having to be scrounging[F] for your next[G] meal.

How does it feel [C] [F] [G]
How does it feel [C] [F] [G]
To be without A home [C] [F] [G]
Like A complete unknown [C] [F] [G]
Like A rolling stone? [C] [F] [G]

Ah,You've[C] gone to the[Dm7] finest school all[Em] right, Miss Lonely
But you[F] know you only used to get[G] juiced in it
And no[C]body has ever taught you[Dm7] how to live on the[Em] street
But now you're[F] gonna have to get[G] used to it
[F]You said you'd never [G]compromise
[F]With the mystery tramp, but now you[G] realize
[F]He's not[C] selling any[Dm7] alibis[C]
[F]As you stare into the[C] vacuum[Dm7] of his[C] eyes
And[Dm] say do you want to[F] make a[G] deal?

How does it feel [C] [F] [G]
How does it feel [C] [F] [G]
To be on your own [C] [F] [G]
With no direction home [C] [F] [G]
Like A complete unknown [C] [F] [G]
Like A rolling stone? [C] [F] [G]

You[C] never turned around to[Dm7] see the frowns on the jugglers and the[Em] clowns
When they[F] all come down and did[G] tricks for you
You[C] never understood that it[Dm7] ain't no good
You[Em] shouldn't let other[F] people get your[G] kicks for you
[F]You used to ride on the chrome horse with your[G] diplomat
[F]Who carried on his shoulder a[G] Siamese cat
[F]Ain't it[C] hard when you di[Dm7]scover that[C]
[F]He really[C] wasn't[Dm7] where it's[C] at
[Dm]After he took from you everything[F] he could[G] steal.

How does it feel [C] [F] [G]
How does it feel [C] [F] [G]
To be on your own [C] [F] [G]
With no direction home [C] [F] [G]
Like A complete unknown [C] [F] [G]
Like A rolling stone? [C] [F] [G]

Princess[C] on the steeple[Dm7] and all the pretty people[Em]
They're drinkin', thinkin'[F] that they[G] got it made
Exchanging[C] all kinds of precious[Dm7] gifts and things[Em]
But you'd better lift[F] your diamond ring,[G] you'd better pawn it babe
[F]You used to be[G] so amused
[F]At Napoleon in rags and the[G] language that he used
[F]Go to him now, he calls[C] you, you can't[Dm7] refuse[C]
[F]When you got nothing[C], you got[Dm7] nothing to lose[C]
[Dm]You're invisible now, you got[F] no secrets to[G] conceal.

How does it feel [C] [F] [G]
How does it feel [C] [F] [G]
To be on your own [C] [F] [G]
With no direction home [C] [F] [G]
Like A complete unknown [C] [F] [G]
Like A rolling stone? [C] [F] [G]
