A
I'm givin' you a piece of my mind
B7
There's no charge of any kind
A
Try a very simple test
B7
You should just retrace your steps
          E
And think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright.
A
Think, think, think back baby
Think, think back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
E                       D     A
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
E                       D     A
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
D
Think about a year ago
B7
How we lived I'll never know
A
Connin' people for a dime
F#7
Here's another piece of my mind
          E
And think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright
A
Think, think, think back baby
Think, think back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
E                       D     A
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
E                       D     A
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
D
Take a look inside yourself
B7
You're not really someone else
A
Still, I am the same old me
F#7
You say I lack maturity
          E
But think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back, alright
A
We're not children anymore
B7
We don't need to play with toys
A
Take a look and you will find
B7
You're gettin' old before your time
          E
But think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright
A
Think, think, think back baby
Think, think I said back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
E                       D     A
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
E                       D     A
Tell me who's fault was that, babe?
E
I said think
You'd better think back a little bit.
I said think.
What about last year and the year before?
I said think.
You promised me so much.
I said think.
Doncha 'member what you said?
