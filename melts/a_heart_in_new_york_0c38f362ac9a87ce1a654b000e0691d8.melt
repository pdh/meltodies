NEW YORK - TO THAT TALL SKYLINE I COME
      Em      C         C/B    Am     Dsus4-D
FLYIN`IN FROM LONDON - TO YOUR DOOR


G                  C   C/B-C/A-C/G-D-Dsus4-D
NEW YORK - LOOKIN`DOWN ON CENTRAL PARK
           Em                 C        G
WHERE THEY SAY YOU SHOULD NOT WANDER - AFTER DARK


G                 C     C/B-C/A-C/G-D-Dsus4-D
NEW YORK - LIKE A SCENE FROM ALL THOSE MOVIES

BUT YOU`RE REAL ENOUGH TO ME - FOR THERE`S A HEART

A HEART THAT LIVES IN NEW YORK

A HEART IN NEW YORK - AROSE ON THE STREET
Am                      Em
I WRITE MY SONG TO THAT CITY HEARTBEAT
  Bm                                   C    C/B
A HEART IN NEW YORK -  THE LOVE IN HER EYES
   Am                Em                   D-Dsus4-D
AN OPEN DOOR - AND A FRIEND FOR THE NIGHT


    G              C-C/B-C/A-C/G-D-Dsus4-D
NEW YORK - YOU GOT MONEY ON YOUR MIND
       Em               C        C/B      Am
AND MY WORDS WON`T MAKE DIME`S - WORTH OF DIFFERENCE
   C         D       G
SO HERE`S TO YOU NEW YORK

AND I`VE FOUND - IT IS FOREVER - DEAR NEW YORK
