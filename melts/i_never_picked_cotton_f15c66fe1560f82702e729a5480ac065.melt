I Never Picked Cotton  (written by Charles Williams/Bobby George)
        --  By Johnny Cash (Unchained album 1996)

    
Chorus  
  E
I never picked cotton
        A      E          A       E
Like my mother did and my brother did
       A      E
And my sister did
       A          E
And my daddy died young
B7             E
  Working in a coal mine


        F
1. When I was just a baby
Too little for the cotton sack
I played in the dirt while the others worked
Til they couldn't straighten their backs
      F#
And I made my self a promise
When I was old enough to run
That I'd never stay a single day
In that Oaklahoma sun
And I...


Chorus

         F
2. Folks said that I grew up early
And the farm couldn't hold me then
So I stole ten bucks and a pick up truck
And I never went back again
           F#
And it was fast cars and wiskey
Long legged girls and fun
I had everything that money could bring
And I took it all with a gun
And I...


Chorus

          F
3. It was Saturday night in Memphis
When a redneck grabbed my shirt
And he said go back to your cotton sack
I left him lyin in the dirt
            F#
And they'll take me in the morning
To the gallows just outside
And in the time I've got their aint a hell of a lot
I can look back on with pride
But I...


Chorus X2
