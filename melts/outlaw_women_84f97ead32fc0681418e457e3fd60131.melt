I've been looking all over for this song and the chords...finally watched somebody play 
so I wrote the chords down and put them to the lyrics...this is my first tab/chord...so 
its wrong let me know I just started playin the guitar so... hope it'll help...

On the intro listen to the beginning of the song to figure the picking out its actually 
badâ€¦

I've seen it play with a Capo on 1 and without...depends on how low or high you wanna 
it...
