              STRAWBERRY CAKE
                JOHNNY CASH

CAPO: 2nd FRET

INTRO: G

VERSE:
G                      D
In New York city just walking the street
                      G  
Ran out of money had nothing to eat
                               C
I stopped at the Plaza, that fancy hotel
       D                                     
Where you can check in if you're well to do well...

     G                   D
The first of July and a hundred and four
                                G
I stopped at the Plaza's front revolving door
                                  C
I stepped in the door and went around for a ride
  D                               
Treatin' myself to the cool air inside

     G                        D
Then I found myself in a chandeliered room
                                G
Where people were dining and I hid in the gloom
                               C
My hunger pains hurt 'til I thought I would break
         D                                  G
When a waiter brought out a big strawberry cake


CHORUS:
G         D         G
Oh that strawberry cake
C                   G
Oh that strawberry cake
    C                    G
Out in California them berries were grown
     C                   G
And into this city them berries were flown
     D                      G
For making that strawberry cake


VERSE:
 G                              D
Then I thought of Oxnard, just north of LA
                                 G
Where I picked strawberries for many a day
                                  C
Hard work with no future for the harvest was done
    D
And I headed eastward a-travelin' by thumb

     G                D
And nobody wanted me here in this town
                              G
I felt like a stray dog they all kick around
                         C
Them berries reminded me of my bad breaks
     D                                 G
I'm hungry and I want that strawberry cake


CHORUS:
G                D         G
I deserve that strawberry cake
   C                     G
Deserve that strawberry cake
   C                         G
I ran and I grabbed it then out the side door
  C                             G
Into Central Park through the bushes I tore
 D                     G
Holdin' my strawberry cake



VERSE:
   G                       D
I look back behind me and what do I see
                             G
The chef and headwaiter and the ma√Ætre d
                         C
I had a nice helpin' of cake as I ran
    D
I gobble them berries as fast as I can

          G                    D
They're closin' the gap as I slowed down to eat
                                     G
But the cake brought a new surge of power to my feet
                            C
I hid in the bush when the lead I did take
        D                             G
And I quietly finished my strawberry cake


CHORUS:
G                 D        G
I ate all that strawberry cake
      C                     G
That fine fancy strawberry cake
    C                    G
Someone at the plaza is without dessert
              C                        G
But for the first time in days now my belly don't hurt
 D                      G
I'm full of strawberry cake

NOTE: THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS I HAVE SEEN JOHNNY CASH
      PLAYING THIS SONG LIVE. ON ONE HE CAPOED AT THE 
      2nd FRET AND ON ANOTHER HE CAPOED ON THE 3rd FRET 
      BUT USED THE EXACT SAME CHORDS FOR BOTH.
