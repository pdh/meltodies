 C G6

 Am F

 Am G F/A


 Am  G       F/A
 Hey hey, my my

 Am       G               F/A
 Rock and roll will never die

         C           G6
 There's more to the picture

 Am              F
  Than meets the eye

 Am   G       F/A
  Hey hey, my my


 intro/verse

 Out of the blue and into the black
 You pay for this and they give you that
 Once you're gone, you can't come back
 When you're out of the blue
 And into the black

 intro/verse

 The king is gone but he's not forgotten
 Is the story of Johnny Rotten?
 It's better to burn out 'cause rust never sleeps
 The king is gone but he's not forgotten

 intro/verse

 Hey hey, my my
 Rock and roll will never die
 There's more to the picture
 Than meets the eye

 Am G F/A
