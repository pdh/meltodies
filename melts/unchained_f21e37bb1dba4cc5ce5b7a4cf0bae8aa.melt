VERSE 1:
A      E       A         E            A
I have  been ungrateful,  I've been unwise
A        E         A       E         A
Restless  from the cradle,  now I realise
E       F#m             D               E       F#m     D E
It’s so hard to see the rainbow through glasses dark as these
A     E        F#m           D   E     A
Maybe, I'll be able from now on, on my knees
A        D          A         D
OoooOhhh I am weak, oh I know I am vain
          A                      E           D     A
Take this weight from me, let my spirit be unchained


VERSE 2: 
A       E                A        E        A
Old man, swearin' at the sidewalk, I’m overcome
A         E              A      E                A
Seems that we've both forgotten, forgotten to go home
A  E      F#m     D      E         F#m    D E
Oh have I seen an angel, oh have I seen a ghost,
A           E        F#m  D              A
Where's that rock of ages when I need it most
A        D          A         D
OoooOhhh I am weak, oh I know I am vain
          A                      E           D     A
Take this weight from me, let my spirit be unchained.
