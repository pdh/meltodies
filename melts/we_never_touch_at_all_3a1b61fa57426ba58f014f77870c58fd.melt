We Never Touch at All

E					A    E          
We're caught in a trap like prisoners in a cage
A                E             B7 
Growing old from hate not from age
    E				  A  E
The runnin' love we had is down to crawl
   A           E           B7             E
We hardly ever talk and we never touch at all
 
You go out with someone else while I'm out with someone too
Yet we come back to prison when we're through
Why don't we just stay out? But we still can climb the wall
We hardly ever talk and we never touch at all
 
    F#				    B
Are we afraid that we'll wind up alone?
   F#					 B
Is this the tide that keeps us hanging on?
Why don't we just stay out while we still can climb the wall?
We hardly ever talk and we never touch at all
