Winter chords
The Rolling Stones 1972

Capo II

C G  2x
C  G           C
Oh oh my my my my . .

         C                      G
And it's sure been a cold, cold winter 
        C                                G
And the wind ain't been blowin' from the south 
     C                      G
It's sure been a cold, cold winter 
        C                           G
And the light of love is all burned out 

   C                      G
It sure been a hard, hard winter 
   C                             G
My feet been draggin' 'cross the ground 
      C                              G
And I hope it's gonna be a long, hot summer 
        D                     C       D
And the light of love will be burnin' bright 

      C                        D
And I wish I'd been out in California 
         C                                      D     
When the lights on all the Christmas trees went out 
           C                         D
But I been burnin' my bell, book and candle 
        C                                D
And the restoration plays have all gone 'round 

   C                      G
It sure been a cold, cold winter 
   C                             G
My feet been draggin' 'cross the ground 
        C                             G
And the fields has all been brown and fallow 
        D                 C         D
And the springtime take a long way around 

            C                          D
Yeah, and I wish I'd been out in Stony Canyon 
         C                                      D
When the lights on all the Christmas trees went out 
           C                         D
But I been burnin' my bell, book and candle 
        C                                D
And the restoration plays have all gone 'round 

     C         G        C G 
Lord well well well

C                           G    C G
Sometimes I think about you baby
C                     G   C G
Sometimes I cry about you
C                               G         C G
Sometimes I wanna wrap my coat around you 
C                               G         C G
Sometimes I wanna wrap my coat around you     . . . .
