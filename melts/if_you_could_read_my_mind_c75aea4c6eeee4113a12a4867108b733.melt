Intro:
|     E     | Dmaj9 | Dmaj9 |     E     |
|     E     | Dmaj9 | Dmaj9 |

E                                  Dmaj9
 If you could read my mind, love,      what a tale my thoughts could tell
E                            Dmaj9
 Just like an old time movie     'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
E                                                                                        
                                                        E7         A   B                    C#m
 In a castle dark, or a fort-ress strong with chains around my feet
 A                      E
 You know that ghost is me
     A            Emaj7/G#        F#m7               B                      E
 And I will never be set free as long as there's a ghost that you can't see
E                                Dmaj9
 If I could read your mind, love,      what a tale your thoughts would tell
E                            Dmaj9
 Just like a paperback novel,      the kind that drugstore's sell
E                       E7              A                   B             C#m
 When you reach the part where the heart aches come, the hero would be me
 A                   E
 But heroes often fail,
     A                    Emaj7/G#    F#m7                  B
 And you won't read that book again be cause the ending's just too hard to
      E
 take
E             E7        A                   B                           C#m
 I'd walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three-way script
 A                E
 Enter number two
   A              Emaj7/G#            F#m7             B/D#               C#m
 A movie queen to play the scene of bringin' all the good things out in me
         A                    E
But for now, love, let's be real
 A                        Emaj7/G#              F#m7               B
 I never thought I could act this way and I've got to say that I just don't

 get it

A                   Emaj7/G#                F#m7                  B/D#
 I don't know where we went wrong, but the feeling's gone and I just can't
              E
 get it back

E                                Dmaj9
 If you could read my mind, love,     what a tale my thoughts could tell
E                            Dmaj9
 Just like an old time movie      'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
E                E7         A                  B                  C#m
 In a castle dark, or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet
     A              E
But stories always end
 A              Emaj7/G#                F#m7                 B/D#
 If you read between the lines, you'll know that I'm just tryin' to
             C#m
 understand
      A                  E
 The feelings that you lack
   A                      Emaj7/G#               F#m7               B
 I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't

 get it
A                   Emaj7/G#                 F#m7                 B/D#
 I don't know where we went wrong, but the feeling's gone and I just can't
              E
 get it back
