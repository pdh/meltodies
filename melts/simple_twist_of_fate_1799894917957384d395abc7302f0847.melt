I feel it is compulsory to listen to Dylan, and to be able to play at least one
of his songs so why not have a go of this one.
Enjoy. HomelessKev.
The chords are the same throughout.



Simple Twist Of Fate :: Bob Dylan  

D
They sat together in the park 
F#m
As the evening sky grew dark, 
D/C                                   G                    Gm 
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones. 
                             D           F#m       G  
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight 
    D                 Gadd9             D
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
