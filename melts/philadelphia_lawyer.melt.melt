This is one of my favourite Guthrie tunes, and it is pretty simple. It should be very 
to transpose as well.

    C               G7
Way out in Reno, Nevada,

                          C
Where romance blooms and fades,

                      F
A great Philadelphia lawyer

        C           G7        C
Was in love with a Hollywood maid.
