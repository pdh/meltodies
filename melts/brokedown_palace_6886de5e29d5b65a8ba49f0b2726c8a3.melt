A                 Bm     C         G                 D
Fare you well, my honey, fare you well my only true one.
A                       Em          C                 D
All the birds that were singing are flown, except you alone.


G                   C
Going to leave this brokedown palace,
      G            Em            C           G
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll.
G             Bm         C    G
Make myself a bed in the waterside,
                  A            C          G
In my time, In my time, I will roll, roll roll.


G         B
In a bed, in a bed,
       C                G      A
By the waterside I will lay my head.
G                   A                    C       G
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.


G                       C
River going to take me, sing me sweet and sleepy,
G                 Em             C        G
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home.
G               Bm            C           G
It's a far gone lullaby, sung many years ago.
                A                      C            G
Mama, mama many worlds I've come since I first left home.


G           B
Goin' home, goin' home,
       C                G       A
By the waterside I will rest my bones,
G                   A                    C       G
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.


G                C
Going to plant a weeping willow,
G                   Em           C           G
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.
G           Bm C          G
Sing a lullaby beside the water,
                A             C           G
Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll.

G              B
Fare you well, fare you well,
  C                  G         A
I love you more than words can tell,
G                   A                    C       G
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.
