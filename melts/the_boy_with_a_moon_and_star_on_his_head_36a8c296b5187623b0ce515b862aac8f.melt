The Boy With A Moon And Star On His Head  by  Cat Stevens

**This is a simpler version of the song which is easier to strum and sing**
      **along to, without all the fast picking riffs**

*For those who want the picking version, I think it's listed under "Tabs"*


VERSE 1:
  D                   G/D              D          G     A      D 
A gardener's daughter stopped me on my way on the day I was to wed,
       Em        G                Em   A          D 
"It is you who I wish to share my body with", she said,
        D                G/D       D          G     A     D  
"We'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed,
            Em         G                    Em       A   Em A  Em A          D 
And for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and star............on his head."
 
                  

VERSE 2:
     D           G/D          D            G     A         F#m Em  D
Her silver hair flowed in the air, laying waves across the suh-huh-hun,
    Em                  G                    Em        A        D  
Her hands were like the white sands, and her eyes had dia-monds on,
    D                G/D    D         G           A       D 
We left the road and headed up to the top of the Whisper Wood,
       Em             G                 Em       A7    D
And we walked till we came to where the holy mag-nolia stood.
  D          G/D          D            G         A      F#m  Bm   Em  A
There we lay cool in the shade singing songs and making love---,
         Em             G               Em  A7     D 
With the naked earth beneath us and the universe above.

     D                G/D             D           Bm         A      D 
The time was late my wedding wouldn't wait, I was sad, but I had to go,
    Em            G                  Em        A7    D 
So while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for cheer-io,
     D                     G/D    D         G     A      D    A  D  B   E   A    D
The wedding took place and people came from many miles a-round
Em                G         Em        A      D 
There was plenty merriment, cider and wine abound,
     D              G/D  D          G            A     D 
But, out of all that I recall, I remembered the girl I met,
       Em                G                Em          A       D 
'Cause she had given me something that my heart could not forget.

A year had passed and everything was just as it was the year before--------
      G       A       D 
As it was the year  before,
  Em                 G              Em     A      D 
Until the gift that someone left, a basket by my door,
    D                 G/D            D    G     A      D 
And in there lay the fairest little baby crying to be fed
   Em            G                    Em     A  Em A  Em   A                 D
I got down on my knees and kissed the moon &amp; star.... Woh, oh-oh,  ...on his head.

    D                G/D       D            G             A     D 
As years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe,
        Em                  G                    Em       A      D 
They'd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before,
     D                     G/D     D            G        A       D
And people would ride from far and wide just to seek the word he spread,
       Em            G                      Em     A7         D 
"I'll tell you everything I've learnt, and love is all!", he said.
