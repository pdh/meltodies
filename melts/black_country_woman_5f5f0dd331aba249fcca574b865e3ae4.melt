I used the software Chordify (google it, it's great) as a rough guide for figuring out the chords. 
Take note: These chords are rough, inaccurate and are mostly a "better than nothing" resource. 
They work, just not very well.

G7                                 G
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here [X2]
C7                                                C
You didn't have to tell me that you love me so 
C7                                             C
You didn't have to love me, mama, let me go 
G7                                 G
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here 
C7                                           C
You didn't have to make me a total disgrace 
C7                                                     C
You didn't have to leave me with that beer in my face 
G7                                  G
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here 
D7              C7                     G
That's alright, it's awful dog-gone clear. 

Hey, hey, baby, why you treat me mean [X2]
You didn't have to crucify me like you did 
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid 
Hey, hey, mama, why'd you treat me mean 
You didn't have say you'd always be by my side 
Y' didn't have to tell me you'd be my blushin' bride 
Hey, hey, mama, why you treat me mean 
But that's alright, I know your sisters, too 

You didn't have to tell me that you love me so 
You didn't have to leave me, mama, let me go 
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you 
You didn't have to leave me like a total disgrace 
You didn't have to leave me with that beer on my face 
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you 
But that's alright, I'd be the same way, too 

You didn't have to crucify me like you did 
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid 
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here 
You didn't have to tell me you would be my own 
You didn't have to tell me, baby, let me go 
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you 
That's alright, I know your sister, too. 

What's the matter with you, mama
