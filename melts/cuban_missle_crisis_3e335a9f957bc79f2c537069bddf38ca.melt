Cuban Missle Crisis
Bob Dylan





   Am               F             Am
Come gather 'round me people, and a story I will tell
                                F            Am
About a night not long ago, you all remember well.
                                      F            Am
I tell it to you straight and true, I tell it like friend
              F                 Am
All about the fearful night, we thought the world would end.
