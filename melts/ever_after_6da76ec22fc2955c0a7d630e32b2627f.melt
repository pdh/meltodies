Ever After

         G         C       G
When you hear that rooster crowing
       D            G
In the dawn, in the dawn
                   C      G
There's really no way of knowing
          D             G
What goes on, what goes on

The world is full of questions
Some are answered, some are not
The only faith you're keepin'
Is the faith that you still got

  C                 G            D            G
I love the sound of laughter and music in the air
    C           G       D                G     C  G  C  G
And in the ever after I know it's always there

A man had many boxes
And he liked them quite a lot
But they would not be opened
'Cause the value would be shot

Sometimes when I go walkin'
In the trees, in the trees
That's where I do my prayin'
In the trees, in the trees

The world is full of answers, 
Some are right, some are wrong
The one that I believe in 
Is a wish in a song

I love to see you smilin' and hear your voice so fair
And in the ever after I know you're always there
