Meet on the Ledge by Richard Thompson
Played live with a capo on 2nd fret so really in Key of A (first chord E)
D  Em
        We used to say
D  D/G  Em
        That come the day
D  D/C#  Bm     Bm7    Am  Am7
    We'd all be making songs
C               G
     Or finding better words
C           G            D
These ideas never lasted long

D  Em
        The way is up
D  D/G  Em
        Along the road
D  D/C#  Bm     Bm7     Am  Am7
     The air is growing thin
C               G
       Too many friends who tried
C                       G                 D    
    Were blown off this mountain with the wind

CHORUS
D                              Am
Meet on the ledge, We're gonna meet on the ledge
C                            G
When my time is up I'm gonna see all my friends
D                              Am
Meet on the ledge, We're gonna meet on the ledge
C                         G
If you really mean it, it all comes round again.


D    Em
        Yet now I see
D  D/G  Em
        I'm all alone
D  D/C#  Bm         Bm7         Am  Am7
     But that's the only way to be
C                       G
       You'll have your chance again
C            G              D 
Then you can do the work for me

Repeat Chorus
