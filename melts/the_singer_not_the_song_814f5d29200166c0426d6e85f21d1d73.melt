(***I got this off an old recording which was badly scratched.
    But this is what it sounded like to me.***)

INTRO:  D Bm   D Bm (Capo Third fret.)

#1.
D                     Bm
Everywhere you want I always go,
D                         Bm        E 
I always give in because, babe, you know.
    A        D            D7         
You just say so cause you give me that 
G         A
feeling inside.
      D      F#m     Bm              G     A  G   A   D   Bm
But I know I must be right..it's the sing..er not the song.

#2. 
D                            Bm
It's not the way you give in willingly.
D                    Bm        E 
Others do it without thrilling me,
     A      D               D7
they just remind me of that same old 
G         A
feeling inside.
       D    F#m     Bm              G   A  G   A   D   Bm
That I know must be right..it's the singer not the song.

#3. 
D                           Bm
The same old places and the same old song..
D                          Bm       E 
We've been going there for much too long.
        A         D            D7            G
There's something wrong and it gives me that feeling 
  A           D      F#m     Bm
inside that I know I must be right...
         G   A  G   A   D   Bm 
It's the singer not the song.(This line x3.)
