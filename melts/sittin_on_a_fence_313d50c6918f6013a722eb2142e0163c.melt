Sittin On A Fence chords
The Rolling Stones 1965

Capo IV (Brian Jones on dulcimer and harpsichord?)

A D E A  E A  A E A E A E

D                           E            A
Since I was young I've been very hard to please
D     E                     A
And I don't know wrong from right
D            
But there is one thing I could never understand
E
Some of the sick things that a girl does to a man, so 

A        D            E     (E A dulcimer)
I'm just sitting on a fence
A       D            E
You can say I got no sense
A              D
Trying to make up my mind
E             A
Really is too horrifying
D      E            A
So I'm sitting on a fence 

D                                       E       A
All of my friends at school grew up and settled down
D        E                  A
And they mortgaged up their lives
D
One things not said too much, but I think it's true
E
They just get married cause there's nothing else to do, so 

A        D            E     (E A dulcimer)
I'm just sitting on a fence
A       D            E
You can say I got no sense
A              D
Trying to make up my mind
E             A
Really is too horrifying
D      E            A
So I'm sitting on a fence 

A D E A  E A  A E A E A E

A        D            E     (E A dulcimer)
I'm just sitting on a fence
A       D            E
You can say I got no sense
A              D
Trying to make up my mind
E             A
Really is too horrifying
D      E            A
So I'm sitting on a fence 

D                                     E                 A
The day can come when you get old and sick and tired of life
D        E        A
You just never realize
D
Maybe the choice you made wasn't really right
E
But you go out and you don't come back at night, so 

A        D            E     (E A dulcimer)
I'm just sitting on a fence
A       D            E
You can say I got no sense
A              D
Trying to make up my mind
E             A
Really is too horrifying
D      E            A
So I'm sitting on a fence 

A D E A  E A  A E A E A E  A
