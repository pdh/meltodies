intro: D A E
E                                                         A
She's elegant she's gracious a lady of the finest social set
F#m            B                               A     
And you're the rich man that can buy her all the world
                       E
And what she wants she gets
E              
You give her charge to count some cheque books
                                        A            F#m
Thinking that's the way to keep her satisfied    
B                                      A                   B              E
But what she needs the most is what no charge or count of checkbook ever buy

    C#m   B    A    F#m                    G#m
The lady is a woman even you should understand
C#m                      A          D                    B           E 
While the lady may need soft things the woman needs a man
    C#m        B   A     F#m                      G#m 
Yes the lady is a woman that you can be certain of
C#m                        A       B                             E
While your lady wants for nothing still your woman wants for love

Bridge: D A E
           E                                                                 A
Well all I do is drive your limousine and chauffer you the way you'd like to go
F#m        B                      A                                        E
But when I look at your lady even I can see there's something you don't know
E                                                                          A       F#m
You give her everything she wanted but not one of the things she really need
        B                       A                    B               E
Yes you still may have your lady but lately now your woman comes to me

     C#m   B    A    F#m                    G#m
your lady is a woman even you should understand
C#m                      A          D                    B           E 
While your lady may need soft things your woman needs a man
        C#m    B   A     F#m                       G#m 
Yes your lady is a woman that you can be certain of
C#m                        A       B                             E
While your lady wants for nothing still your woman wants for love
