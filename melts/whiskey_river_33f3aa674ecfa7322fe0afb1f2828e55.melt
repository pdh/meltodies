G                     C     
Whiskey River take my mind
                             G   
Don't let her memory torture me
                        D7    
Whiskey River don't run dry
                                 G    
You're all I've got take care of me
 
                          C      
I'm drowning in a whiskey river
G                         
Bathing my mem'ried mind
       A7             D7     
In the wetness of its soul
G                          
Feeling the amber current
G7              C     
Flowing from my mind
    D7                          G      
And leaving a heart you left so cold
 
                      C     
Whiskey River take my mind
                             G   
Don't let her memory torture me
                        D7    
Whiskey River don't run dry
                                 G    
You're all I've got take care of me
 
                          C      
I'm drowning in a whiskey river
G                         
Bathing my mem'ried mind
       A7             D7     
In the wetness of its soul
G                          
Feeling the amber current
G7              C     
Flowing from my mind
    D7                          G      
And leaving a heart you left so cold
