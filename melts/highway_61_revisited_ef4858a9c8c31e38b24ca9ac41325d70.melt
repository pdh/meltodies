                    Like A Rolling Stone
                    --------------------

C                    Dm
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
    Em                    F              G
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
C                    Dm                  Em
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
    F                     G
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
F           G
 You used to laugh about
F                  G
 Everybody that was hangin' out
F         Em   Dm     C
 Now you don't talk so loud
F         Em   Dm     C
 Now you don't seem so proud
      Dm           F                        G
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.

            C     F G
How does it feel
            C     F G
How does it feel
                C    F G
To be without a home
                  C      F G
Like a complete unknown
               C       F  G
Like a rolling stone?

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts 
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

                             Tombstone Blues
                             ---------------

Capo: 2nd fret

    E                          
The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
                               
The city fathers they're trying to endorse
                   
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
                    A          E
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

A
Mama's in the factory
          E
She ain't got no shoes
A 
Daddy's in the alley
     E
He's lookin' for food 
A
I'm in the kitchen
                   E
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, "I've just been made"
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, "My advice is to not let the boys in"

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison"

Mama's in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, "Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saying, "The sun's not yellow it's chicken"

Mama's in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

Mama's in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for food
I'm in trouble
With the tombstone blues

The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

Mama's in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Mama's in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for the fuse
I'm in the streets
With the tombstone blues

             It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry       
             -------------------------------------------------

To play the song correctly you have to play the following pattern
througout most of the song (shuffle style!)

|--3--3--3--3--|
|--0--0--1--0--|
|--0--0--0--0--|
|--0--0--2--0--|
|--2--2--x--2--|
|--3--3--3--3--|
   .  .  .  . 
   G  G  C  G

---&gt; Repeat this "Riff" throughout the verses with some other chords
     (tabbed below) and with a capo on the 1st fret.

"Riff"
Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby,
"Riff"
Can't buy a  thrill.
"Riff"
Well, I've been up all night,
"Riff"
Leanin' on the window sill.
      G    G7
Well, if I die
   C          D   
On top of the hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiilllllllll
"Riff"
And if I don't make it,
"Riff"
You know my baby  will.

Don't the moon look good, mama,
Shinin' through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama,
Flagging down the Double E?
Don't the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
Don't my gal look fine
When she's comin' after me?

Now the wintertime is coming,
The windows are filled with frost.
I went to tell everybody,
But I could not get across.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby,
I don't wanna be your boss.
Don't say I never warned you
When your train gets lost.

                         From A Buick 6
                         --------------

C
           
I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kid

But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid
F                                              C
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
           G                                                        C
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge
I'm cracked up on the highway and on the water's edge
She comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

Well, you know I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead
I need a dump truck mama to unload my head
She brings me everything and more, and just like I said
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.

                            --------------------

Played very slowly (q~65) and with a Capo on the 2nd fret. The timing of the
intro tab seems to be a bit awkward but it's right. You can try it out if you
have Guitar Pro.

         (Am)     Am    Dm    Am    (Am)

Am
You walk into the room
/g#
With your pencil in your hand
/G
You see somebody naked
       /F#
And you say, "Who is that man?"
F
You try so hard
        Dm
But you don't understand
C                  Em
Just what you will say
             Am
When you get home
  C                  Em            
Because something is happening here
        Am
But you don't know what it is
F              Am       "intro"
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head                    
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"                
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God
Am I here all alone?"

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is 
Do you, Mister Jones?

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel
To be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Am
You have many contacts
C
Among the lumberjacks
   F
To get you facts
                               Am
When someone attacks your imagination

But nobody has any respect
C
Anyway they already expect you
   F
To just give a check
   Dm                           G        G7
To tax-deductible charity organizations

You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have                  
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word "NOW"
And you say, "For what reason?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home"

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

                         Queen Jane Approximately
                         ------------------------


          F      Em             Dm       C
When your mother sends back all your invitations
         F              Em     Dm   G
And your father to your sister he explains
            C            F                    C        /C   /B   Am
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations
C                 F          C       F
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
C              F             C
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And you're sick of all this repetition
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

When all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

                        Highway 61 Revisited
                        --------------------

Capo: 1st fret

  A
Oh God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"

Abe says, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"

God say, "No." Abe say, "What?"

God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
    D                                      A
The next time you see me comin' you better run"
     E
Well Abe says, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
A
God says, "Out on Highway 61."

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there's only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
0l' Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61.

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61.

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
He was tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues
                     ---------------------------

            G                      C                       G
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Eastertime too
         G                     C                     G
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through
      C                                              G
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
              D                      C                            G
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outa you


Now if you see Saint Annie please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move my fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor won't even say what it is I've got

Sweet Melinda the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon

Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame
You must pick up one or the other though neither of them are to be
      what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly you better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you ynd man they expect the same

Now all the authorities they just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost

I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough
But the joke was on me there was nobody even there to call my bluff
I'm going back to New York City I do believe I've had enough
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Desolation Row
                             --------------

You can play it in dropped C-tuning (Tune E-Bass string down to C)
In dropped C tuning the chords are played like this:

C: 032010  Csus4: 033010  F(/C): 003211  G(/D): 220003

Capo: 4th fret

C        
They're selling postcards of the hanging
        F                      C
They're painting the passports brown
    G     
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
F                C
The circus is in town
C        
Here comes the blind commissioner
        F            C
They've got him in a trance
            G     
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
    F               C
The other is in his pants
        F
And the riot squad they're restless
     C                 F
They need somewhere to go
   C               G
As Lady and I look out tonight
     F          C        Csus4
From Desolation Row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
"It takes one to know one," she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
"You Belong to Me I Believe"
And someone says," You're in the wrong place, my friend
You better leave"
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortunetelling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
He looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
"Have Mercy on His Soul"
They all play on penny whistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They're spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
"Get Outa Here If You Don't Know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row"

Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
"Which Side Are You On?"
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the door knob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row
