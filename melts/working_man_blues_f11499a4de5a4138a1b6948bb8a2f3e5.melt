                        Workin' Man Blues - Jed Zepplin

Intro:  A7 (8 bars)

Verse1: A
        It's a big job just gettin' by with 9 kids and a wife

        I been a workin' man dang near all my life
                D7
        I'll be working
                                        A
        long as my two hands are fit to use
             E7
        I'll drink my beer in a tavern,
        D7                                      A
        sing a little bit of these working man blues


Verse2: I keep my nose on the grindstone, I work hard every day
        might get a little tired on the weekend, after I draw my pay
        but I'll go back workin,
        come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew
        I'll drink a little beer that evening,
        sing a little bit of these working man blues

Verse3: Hey hey, the working man, the working man like me
        I ain't never been on welfare, that's one place I won't be
        cause I'll be working
        long as my two hands are fit to use
        I drink a little beer in a tavern
        sing a little bit of these working man blues

        [SOLO - one verse]

Verse4: Sometimes I think about leaving, do a little bummin around
        I wanna throw my bills out the window catch a train to another town
        but I go back working
        I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
        yeah drink a little beer in a tavern,
        cry a little bit of these working man blues

        [VERSE3]

        yeah drink a little beer in a tavern,
        cry a little bit of these working man blues

        (this song is for THE workin man, Mr. Merle Haggard)
