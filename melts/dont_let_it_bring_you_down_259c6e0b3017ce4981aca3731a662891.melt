 Don't Let It Bring You Down : After The Goldrush : Neil Young

 Intro:
 A G A C    (x2)

 A                                    
 Old man lying by the side of the road

          Am7               
 With the lorries rolling by

 D                                            
 Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load

         F                    Em7 
 And the buildings scrape the sky       

                                          
 Cold wind rippling down the alley at dawn
 And the morning paper fly
 Dead man lying at the side of the road
 And the daylight in his eyes

 Chorus:
 Em7            D7            
   Don't let it bring you down

                   C      
 It's only castles burning

                    Bm7    
 Find someone who's turning

                    A    
 And you will come around

 G A C  A G A C
              
 Blind man running through the light of the night
 With an answer in his hand
 Come on down to the river of sight and
 You can really understand
                                                  
 Red light flashin' through the window in the rain
 Can you hear the sirens moan?
 White cane lying in the gutter in the lane 
 And you're walking home alone
       
 Chorus

 A                          
 Don't let it bring you down

                   D            
 It's only castles burning just

                    Bm7    
 Find someone who's turning
   
   
                    A    
 And you will come around

 G A C
     
 A G A C

 A                          
 Don't let it bring you down

                   D            
 It's only castles burning  just

                    Bm7    
 Find someone who's turning
   
                    A    
 And you will come around

 G A C
     
 A D A D

 is on piano - the closest we can get on guitar is the following:

 Gm7 (53333)
 Chorus:  Gm7  F7III (3545) EbIII (5343) Dm7 (3211)
 Chorus2 (first time) C (332010) F Dm7 (0211) 
 CIII (5553) Bb CIII EbIII
 Chorus2 (2nd time) C F Dm7 
 CIII FVIII (10,10,10,8) CIII FVIII
 or retune your guitar (to D) and change accordingly
