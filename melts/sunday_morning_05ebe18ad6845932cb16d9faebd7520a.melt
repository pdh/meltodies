Sunday Morning by The Velvet Under Ground
from "The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico 1967 Verve
written by Lou Reed

Here is an open chord version for guitar.
I know the Album version of this song is tuned down to match
Cale's Viola but I dont know how much.
This version is for standard tuning.

Sunday Morning, The Velvet Underground

G      C
Sunday morning
G          C
Brings the dawn in
G           Em
It's just a restless feeling
Am    D
By my side
G     C
Early dawning
G      C
Sunday Morning
G             Em
It's just the wasted years
   Am     D
So close  behind
(Chorus)
G            C
Watchout the worlds behind ya
G                  C
Theres always some one around ya
         Am                  D
who will call it's nothin at all


Sunday Maorning
And I'm falling
Iv'e got a feeling
I dont want to know.
Early dawning
Sunday morning
It's all the streets you crossed
not so long ago

(Chorus)
(Solo)
(Chorus)

(end by repeating "Sunday morning" to fade)

A few things I've added to this are nuances from live
versions of the songs
1. I like to do a little flip on the (D) chords that goes like this

E-2-3-2-0-2-|
B-3-3-3-3-3-|
G-2-2-2-0-2-|
D-0-0-0-0-0-|
A-x-x-x-x-x
E-x-x-x-x-x

2. On "Live In 1969" they shuffle (G) and (C) in the closing
refrain of "Sunday morning"

G      C       C C C G C G
Sunday Morning


The solo is a little beyond me and I couldn't tab it any way
because I'm not sure what the true tuning is.
I read about the tune down in the notes for the box set but I
don't own it. Perhaps someone could help on that note.
