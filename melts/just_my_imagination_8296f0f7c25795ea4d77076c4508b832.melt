VERSE:
     A                       D                     A   D
      I look out my window watch her as she passes by
         A                 D            A   D
      I say to myself I'm such a lucky guy
     A                     D         A         D
      To have a girl like her is a dream come true
              A                    D         A           D
      And of all the girls in New York she loves me true


CHORUS:
              A                    D
      It was just my imagination, once again
       A                   D
      Running away with me
              A               D
      It was just my imagination
               A           D
      Running away with me


VERSE:
      Soon we'll be married and raise a family
      Two boys for you, what about two girls for me
      I tell you I am just a fellow with a one track mind
      Whatever it is I want baby I seek and I shall find
      I'll tell ya


CHORUS:


INSTRUMENTAL:  A  D -- 8x's


BREAK:

     A
      Every night I hope and pray
      "Dear Lord, hear my plea
      Don't ever let another take her love from me
                  E
      Or I will surely die"
                  A
      Her love is ecstasy
      When her arms unfold me
      I hear her tender rhapsody
      But in reality, she doesn't even know me

CHORUS:

CHORUS:

INSTRUMENTAL:  PLAY CHORDS TO CHORUS

CHORUS:

  (THEN) ........ RUN-A-WAY, RUN-A-WAY, ETC.... TO FADE OUT
