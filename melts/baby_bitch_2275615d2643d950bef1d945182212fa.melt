This Am7 change is just a quick hammer off then on back to Am, similar to
the D and Dsus change at the end of verses.        \  /

Em              G         D            Am   Am7 Am
It's been a while since I've seen you smile
     Em         G          D
But now you've come back again
      Em        G           D      Am   Am7 Am
Came into the room and you saw my girl
          Em            G        D
And you asked her how long it's been
  Em          G             D         Am   Am7 Am
"A year" she said and you shook your head
          Em              G            D   Dsus D
Said "I'm surprised it's gone on that long"
 
Em    G     D     Am   Am7 Am
Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
    Em      G        D
For words I am at a loss
 Em    G     D    Am   Am7 Am
Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
      Em         G          D
I'm better now please fuck off

     Em            G                D            Am   Am7 Am
What else you gonna say while you're back on your stay
      Em               G              D
Maybe something, maybe nothing, we'll see
     Em      G           D           Am   Am7 Am
It's just too bad, you're beautiful I guess
  Em         G           D             Dsus D
I wasn't for you and you weren't for me
 
Em    G     D    Am   Am7 Am
Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
       Em        G        D
Please slip back into yourself
Em    G     D    Am   Am7 Am
Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
Em         G       D
Go conquer someone else
 
Em              G              D           Am   Am7 Am
People say, "How beautiful, how sweet, how kind"
       Em                  G          D
You're perfect, you've got nothing to hide
    Em     G         D        Am   Am7 Am
But I, for one, have seen the sun
        Em                G           D    Dsus D
And the bitch that you've locked up inside

    Em       G              D        Am   Am7 Am
Got fat, got angry, started hating myself
       Em       G            D
Wrote "Birthday Boy" for you babe
        Em        G        D    Am   Am7 Am
Now I'm skinny and sick and paranoid
Em        G          D    Dsus D
Without a cent to my name
 
Em    G     D    Am   Am7 Am
Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
Em            G            D
Fuck you, you stinkin' ass ho
     Em         G
Most beauty I've seen
    D           Am
You come from a dream
      Em             G    D
But I can't close my eyes anymore
      Em             G    D
No, I can't close my eyes anymore
