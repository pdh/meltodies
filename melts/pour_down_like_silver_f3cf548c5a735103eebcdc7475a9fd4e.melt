STREETS OF PARADISE

Dm
The tears fall down like whiskey, the tears fall down like wine
C
On an island made of cocaine in a sea of turpentine
G
We all need some assistance but won't that day be fine
           C                F              C
When we're walking down the streets of paradise


Tar brush on the corner, I've never seen him before
He drank ten fingers of what they had, now his feet don't touch the
floor
He can't see me or this dirty old town, he's got nothing to look for
He's a-walking down the streets of paradise
F                              C
Walking down the streets of paradise
F       C/E      Dm         C
Walking down the streets of paradise

I'd trade my silver mansion with a guard on every door
I'd trade my wealth and treasure and the sash my father wore
I'd trade my little sister and my brother who went before
To be walking down the streets of paradise

Walking down the streets of paradise
Walking down the streets of paradise

I asked you for a racehorse, now don't hand me no mule
I asked you for a fast car, don't you take me for a fool
Just hand me down my telescope and a bullet I can chew
I'll be walking down the streets of paradise

Walking down the streets of paradise
Walking down the streets of paradise


FOR SHAME OF DOING WRONG

(Intro Chords)
E D A E Asus* A  (* Asus could also be D/A (no third))

E               D        A       E   A Asus A
It seems like a lifetime since I saw you
E                  D     A       E
Lover, lover, I've been away too long
     A                              E
When I see lovers holding hands and sighing
  A                               E
I hang my head for shame of doing wrong

(repeat intro chords)

Bus wheels spinning, songbirds singing, break my heart
Take me back to old remembered days
Remind me of the times we spent together
Times before we went our separate ways

  A                          E
I wish I was a fool for you again
  A                          E
I wish I was a fool for you again
  A                          E
I wish I was a fool for you again

I'm sorry for the things I've said, the things I've done
I'm sorry for the restless thief I've been
Please don't make me pay for my deceiving heart
Just turn up your lamp and let me in

I wish I was a fool for you again
I wish I was a fool for you again
I wish I was a fool for you again

(repeat)
(repeat intro chords and end)


THE POOR BOY IS TAKEN AWAY

C
Gold-haired poor boy, you took him for fun
   F               G         C
He dressed for the tinkering trade
   F               G         C
He dressed for the tinkering trade
        F             C/E Dm C
Now the poor boy is taken a-way

No use waiting like a ghost in a dream
The world has no comfort to bring
The world has no comfort to bring
He left you to get everything

No use standing, waving adieu
The penny won't drop in your mind
The penny won't drop in your mind
The old flame's left you behind

No use crying in a room full of memories
You never will find yesterday
You never will find yesterday
And the poor boy is taken away


NIGHT COMES IN

A7sus                          Em
Night comes in, like some cool river
              D   C          A7sus
How can there be, be another day?
A7sus                    Em
Take my hand, oh real companion
          D      C                   A7sus
And we'll dance, dance till we fade away

Oh, the sands pour down like silver
They can only, only break my heart
Drink the wine, the wine of lovers
Lovers tired of being apart

F#m                                  A
Dancing till my feet don't touch the ground
F#m                G
I lose my mind and dance forever
F#m              G
Lose my mind and dance forever
C              D
Turn my world around
C              D
Turn my world around

E(m) C D A7sus

Oh, this night is like no other
And this room is ringing in my ears
And these friends will never leave me
And these tears are like no other tears

Dancing till my feet don't touch the ground
I lose my mind and dance forever
Lose my mind and dance forever
Turn my world around
Turn my world around


JET PLANE IN A ROCKING CHAIR

Jet plane in a rocking chair
Roller coaster roll nowhere
Deaf and dumb ?or dance it there?
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time

Sea cruise in a diving bell
Run a mile in a wishing well
?Soft soap? and nothing to sell
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time

Here comes the real thing
I've been waiting for so long, for so long
I've been looking for a love like you

Crossed line on a telephone
Crossed lies on a  . . .
Crossed fingers and head for home
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time

They sink in a feather bed
?Got cool when you're stoned and dead?
I'm a fool with a size one head
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time

Here comes the real thing
I've been waiting for so long, for so long
I've been looking for a love like you

Jet plane in a rocking chair
Roller coaster roll nowhere
Deaf and dumb ?or dance it there?
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time
This time, this time
This time, this time


BEAT THE RETREAT

Beat my retreat, back home to you
Beat my retreat, back home to you
I'm burning all my bridges
I'm burning all my bridges
I'm burning all my bridges
I'm running back home to you

Trailing my colours, back home to you
Trailing my colours, back home to you
This world is filled with sadness
This world is filled with sadness
This world is filled with sadness
I'm running back home to you

Follow the drum, back home to you
Follow the drum, back home to you
There was no sense in my leaving
There was no sense in my leaving
There was no sense in my leaving
I'm running back home to you


HARD LUCK STORIES

They say running into you is like running into trouble
Bend my ear and I see double
You're everybody's idea of a waste of time
You still come around 'cause I used to listen
I run a steamship, I don't run a mission
Don't be mistaken in thinking you're a friend of mine

(Chorus)
Those hard luck stories, it's all I ever get from you
Hard luck stories, you're gonna drive me out of my mind
Those hard luck stories, it's all I ever get from you
Hard luck stories, you're gonna drive me out of my mind

Well, cops won't give you change of a penny
Everybody's got money but you haven't any
If I cared about you I'd say it was a crying shame
Your wife ran away, left you on a Sunday
She cried when she left, she was laughing on Monday
She should have known better and never gone and changed the name

(Chorus)

Why don't you grow up, why don't you settle down?
Why don't you get a job, why don't you leave town?
Even a chicken has to do what it has to do
You don't like one thing, you don't like another
You don't like anything that looks like bother
Everyone don't like something and we all don't like you

(Chorus)


DIMMING OF THE DAY/DARGAI

C                                        G
This old house is falling down around my ears
F                   C           G
I'm drowning in the river of my tears
C                                     G
When all my will is gone, you hold me sway
F                 C       G      C
I need you at the dimming of the day

    G                                  D
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
    G                                D
You know just where I keep my better side?

G  C  F


What days have come to keep us far apart?
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night, you're only what I want
Come the night, you could be my confidant

I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me?
I'm living for the night we steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
I need you at the dimming of the day
