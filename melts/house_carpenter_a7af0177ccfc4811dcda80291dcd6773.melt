     G
Well met, well met, my own true love
    G          G7         G
Well met, well met, cried she

I've just returned from the salt, salt sea

And it's all for the sake of thee

VERSE 2
  G
I could have married a King's daughter there
    G          G7      G
She would have married me
     G        G7         G
Then I have refused that crown of gold 
         G
And it's all for the sake of thee


VERSE 3
       G
If you could have married a King's daughter there
    G
I'm sure you are to blame
    G    G7           G
For I am married to a house carpenter
    G                 [G]
And he is a fine young man

VERSE 4
   G      G7       G
If you forsake your house carpenter
    G    G7       G
And fly away with me
     G
I'll take you to where the grass grows green
       D         C     G  D
On the banks of sweet Willie [?]


VERSE 5
   G
If I forsake my house carpenter
    G    G7       G
And fly away with thee
G             G7         G
What have you got to maintain me upon
    G
And keep me from slavery


VERSE 6
     G         G7      G
I've six ships sailing on the salt sea
G       G7       G
Sailing from dry land
      G           G7     G
And a hundred and twenty jolly young men
      G     G7     G
Shall be at your command

VERSE 7
    G      G7     G
She picked up her poor little babe
    G
Her kisses were one, two, three
    G      G7    G
And as she trod upon her way
    G            G7         G
And shone like a glittering tree


VERSE 8
     G       G7      G
They had not been at sea two weeks
    G       G7      G
I'm sure it was not three
G 
When this poor maid began to cry
        G         G7    G
And she wept most bitterly

VERSE 9
   G      G7            G
Oh do you weep for your gold, he said
     G            G7           G
Your houses, your land or your store?
   G      G7            G
Or do you weep for your house carpenter
    G                G7     G
The one you’ll never see anymore
    G                G7     G
The one you’ll never see anymore


VERSE 10
  G      G7          G
I do not weep for my gold, she said
   G          G7         G
My houses, my land or my store
      G  G7          G
But I do weep for my poor little babe
     G
That I never shall see anymore

VERSE 11
  G      G7          G
They had not been at sea three weeks
    G       G7      G
I'm sure it was not four
   G          G7         G
When in their ship there sprang a great leak
        G          
And she sank to rise no more
        G       G7      G
No, she sank to rise no more


VERSE 12
    G        G7       G
Farewell farewell, my own true love
    G        G7          G
Farewell farewell, cried she
  G            G7        G
I could have deserted my house carpenter
    G
And grave them [?] in the depths of the sea
      G            G7            G
For a grave in the depths of the sea.

I've just returned from the salt, salt sea

And it's all for the sake of thee
