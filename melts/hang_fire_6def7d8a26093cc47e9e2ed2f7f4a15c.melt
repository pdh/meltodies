Rolling Stones â€“ Hang Fire

Tabbed by Uchiha23


Intro: D         E
       
       A            F#m          D            E
       
       A            F#m          D            E

Verse 1: In the sweet old country where I come from,
         nobody ever works, nothing ever gets done,
         We hang Fire, We hang fire.
         You know marrying money is a full-time job,
         I don't need the aggravation, I'm a lazy slob.

Chorus:  We hang Fire, A'hang fire, hang fire hang,
         Put it on the wire, baby.
         Hang Fire, hang fire,
         Put it on the wire, baby.



Bridge:  A                      E
         (We got) nothing to eat, we got nowhere to work.

         A                      E
         Nothing to drink,   we just lost our shirt.

         A                      E
         I'm on the dole,       We ain't for hire.

         D                      E
         Say what the hell,     Say what the hell!

Chorus:  A          F#m        D
         Hang Fire, hang fire, Hang fire, hang fire,


         E
         Put it on the wire, baby.

         Hang Fire, hang fire, Hang fire, hang fire,
         Put it on the wire, baby.

Verse 2: Yeh! take a thousand dollars, go and have some fun,
         Put it all on at a hundred to one.
         Hang Fire, We hang fire,
         Put it on the wire, baby.
