(The parts that don't have the chords, is to be played like the chorus)

 
It ALL began when they come took me from my home
And put me on Death Row,
a crime for which I am totally innocent, you know.

  Am		       E
I began to warm and chill
  Am		        E
To objects and their fields,
  Am		        E
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
  Am		         E
The face of Jesus in my soup
  Am		         E
Those sinister dinner deals
  Am		            E
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
  Am		              E
A hooked bone rising from my food
  Am		              E
All things either good or ungood.

Am
And the mercy seat is waiting
AmMaj7
And I think my head is burning
Am7
And in a way I'm yearning
       G                                   Gm
To be done with all this weighing of the truth.

An eye for an eye
                   Bb
And a tooth for a tooth
                      Fmaj7
And anyway I told the truth
                       Am
And I'm not afraid to die.

Am / E / Am / E

Am
I hear stories from the chamber
AmMaj7
Christ was born into a manger
Am7
And like some ragged stranger
     G                           Gm
He died upon the cross. Might I say, 
                           Bb
it seems so fitting in its way 
                      Fmaj7    
He was a carpenter by trade
			      Am
Or at least that's what I'm told

Am / E / Am / E




Am 	    		   E
My kill-hand's tatooed E.V.I.L. 
Am			E
across it's brother's fist
Am		E					
That filthy five! 
Am				    E
They did nothing to challenge or resist.

Am				AmMaj7
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
				Am7
The ark of his Testament is stowed

A throne from which I'm told
     G                           
All history does unfold.
Gm
It's made of wood and wire
       Bb
And my body is on fire
Fmaj7                 Am
And God is never far away.


Am			AmMaj7
Into the mercy seat I climb
                               Am7
My head is shaved, my head is wired
   		 
And like a moth that tries
   G
To enter the bright eye
     Gm
I go shuffling out of life
        Bb
Just to hide in death awhile
Fmaj7              Am
And anyway I never lied.


Am			
And the mercy seat is waiting
AmMaj7                       
And I think my head is burning
Am7
And in a way I'm yearning
      G 				   Gm
To be done with all this weighing of the truth. 

An eye for an eye
                  Bb
And a tooth for a tooth
                       Fmaj7      
And anyway I told the truth
		       Am
And I'm not afraid to die.

 
Am			
And the mercy seat is burning
AmMaj7                 
And I think my head is glowing
Am7
And in a way I'm hoping
      G 				   Gm
To be done with all this twisting of the truth.

An eye for an eye
                  Bb
And a tooth for a tooth
                        Fmaj7      
And anyway there was no proof
		       Am
And I'm not afraid to die.



Am	               
And the mercy seat is glowing
AmMaj7                       
And I think my head is smoking
Am7
And in a way I'm hoping
      G 	                 	Gm
To be done with all these looks of disbelief.

A life for a life
                  Bb
And a truth for a truth
                             Fmaj7      
And I've got nothing left to lose
		       Am
And I'm not afraid to die.



Am	               
And the mercy seat is smoking
AmMaj7                       
And I think my head is melting
Am7
And in a way that's helping
      G 	             	          Gm
To be done with all this twisting of the truth

An eye for an eye
                  Bb
And a tooth for a tooth
                      Fmaj7      
And anyway I told the truth
     		         Am
But I'm afraid I told a lie.
