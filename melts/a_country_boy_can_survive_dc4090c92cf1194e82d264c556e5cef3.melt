A Country Boy Can Survive

By: Hank Williams Jr.
       
        D                             A
	The preacher man says its the end of time
                G                        D
	And the Mississippi River shes a goin dry
        D                          A
	The interest is up and the stock markets down
                G                      D
	And you only get mugged if you go down town

        D                  A
	I live back in the woods you see
           G                          D
	My woman and the kids and the dogs and me
        D                             A
	I got a shotgun a rifle and a four wheel drive
              G           A   D
	And a country boy can survive
        A             G   D
	Country folks can survive

        D                  A
	I can plow a field all day long
              G                  D
	I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn
        D                               A
	We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
              G                         D
	Ain't too many things these ole boys can't do
                                      A
	We grow good ole tomatoes and homemade wine
              G           A   D
	And a country boy can survive
        A             G   D
	Country folks can survive	

Chorus 

                    G                           F
	Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
              C                        G
	Cause when them ole boy raised on shotgun
                         F
	We say grace and we say ma'am
               C                    G                  
	If you ain't into that we don't give a damn


        D                       A
	We came from the West Virginia coal mines
                G                       D
	And the Rocky Mountains and the Western Skies
                                      A
	And we can skin a buck we can run a trot line
              G           A   D
	And a country boy can survive
        

        A             G   D
	Country folks can survive
        D                      A
	I had a good friend in New York City
           G                          D
	He never called me by my name just HillBilly
                                A
	My GrandPa taught me to live off the land
            G                      D
	And his taught him to be a business man
                                           A
	He used to send me pictures of the Broadway Night
            G                 D
	And I'd send him some homemade wine
                                          A
	But he was killed by a man with a switch blade knife
            G                     D
	For forty three dollars my friend lost his life
                                          A
	I'd love to spit some Beechnut in that dudes eye
            G                     D
	And shoot em' with my ole 45
                A           G   D        
	Cause a country boy can survive
        A             G   D
	Country folks can survive

Chorus..................


        D                              A
	Were from North California and South Alabam
            G                D
	And little towns all around this land
                                   A
	And we can skin a buck and run a trot line
              G           A   D
	And a country boy can survive
        A             G   D
	Country folks can survive
        A           G   D
	Country boy can survive
        A             G   D          A    G   D
	Country folks can survive................
