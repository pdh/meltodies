Everywhere I hear the sound of marching charging feet boy
Cos summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street boy

CHORUS:
G   Gsus9    G           Gsus9
But what can a poor boy do
  G                         Gsus9
Except to sing for a rock'n'roll band
G      Gsus9  G                            Gsus9 G
Cos in sleepy London town there's just no place  for
                D
Street fighting man, no

Hey think the time is right for valorious revolution
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution
CHORUS

Hey so my name has caused disturbance
I shout and scream, I kill the King, I rail at all his servants
CHORUS
Get down!
