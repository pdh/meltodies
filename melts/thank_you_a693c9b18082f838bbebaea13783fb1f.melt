           D                C
If the sun refused to shine
G                     D
I would still be loving you
D                                      C
When mountains crumble to the sea
G                              D
There would still be you and me

Bm             E
Kind of women, I give you my all
Bm                    E           A
Kind of women, nothing more

C
Little drops of rain
G
Whisper on the plains
D                                       D4  D
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
C
And my love is strong
G
Here there is no wrong
D                                 D4  D
Together we shall go until we die

An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, love you see

And so today my world it smiles
Your hand in mine we walk the miles
But thanks to you, it will be done
For you, to me, are the only one

Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I am glad

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There would still be you and me

This is the way I play it on my western guitar. I hope it helps you.
Have fun!!
