1.  
A                              E 
Something happened to me yesterday,  
D                                 A 
something I can't speak of right away.  
D         Fm      Bm     E                 E7 
Something happened to me, something, oh, so groovy,  
D         E        D     E       A 
something happened to me yester..day.  
CHORUS:   
D                                     A                  
He don't know if it's right or wrong, maybe 

he should tell someone,  
D                               A 
he's not sure just what it was, or if it's

against the law. 
E
Something.. A D A E A 
2.   
A                                 E 
Something very strange I hear you say,  
D                                 A 
you're talking in a most peculiar way.  
    D         Fm    Bm        E                 E7 
But something really threw me, something, oh, so groovy,  
D         E        D     E       A 
something happened to me yester..day. 
CHORUS:   
D                                   A 
He don't know just where it's gone, he don't

really care at all,  
D                               A 
no one's sure just what it was, or the

meaning and the cause.  
E 
Something... A D A E A 
ADD CHORUS:   
D                                     A 
He don't know if it's right or wrong, maybe 

he should tell someone,  
D                               A 
he's not sure just what it was, or if

it's against the law.

Something.... A D A E A 
3.   
A                                      E 
Someone says there's something more to pay,  
D                                 A 
for sins that you committed yesterday. 
     D      Fm    Bm          E                 E7 
It's really rather drippy, but something, oh, so trippy,  
D         E        D     E       A 
something happened to me yester..day. 
CHORUS:   
D                                   A 
He don't know just where it's gone, he don't

really care at all,  
D                               A 
no one's sure just what it was, or the meaning

and the cause.  
E 
Something.... A D A E A 
4.   
A                                 E 
Someone's singing loud across the bay,  
D                        A 
sittin on a mat about to pray.
D     Fm     Bm        E                 E7 
Isn't half as looney as something, oh, so groovy, 
D         E        D     E       A 
something happened to me yester..day. 
CHORUS:   
D                                     A 
He don't know if it's right or wrong, maybe 

he should tell someone,  
D                               A 
he's not sure just what it was, or if 

it's against the law
