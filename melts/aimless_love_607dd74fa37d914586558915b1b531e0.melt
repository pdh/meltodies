A                                D
He's just a small fry. A bit too gun shy.
            A                       E
To have his heart touched without a glove
            A                      D
He looks at strangers as potential dangers
          A         E       A
Trying to Steal his aimless love.




Chorus:
         D                       A
Love has no mind. It can't spell unkind.
                                           E
It's never seen a heart shaped like a Valentine
            A                      D
For if love knew him. It'd walk up to him
         A              E       A
And introduce him to an aimless love




           A                     D
I been out walking. Kinda pillow talking
   A                            E
To anyone that has the time for me
              A                          D
For there are some folks they think that love chokes.
            A          E          A
It ties and keeps them from being free




(Repeat Chorus 3x)
