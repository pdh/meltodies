Found someone new
C                                       G
To do the things I used to do for you
G
Just call my name

I'm not ashamed

Just like a king, I've lost everything

I try to forget
B7
Have no regrets
C                                              G
This love of ours could always start anew
G
Just call my name

Whoa, I know I'm not ashamed
G             D                      G
I'll come running back to you


G7
Just like a king, I've lost everything
