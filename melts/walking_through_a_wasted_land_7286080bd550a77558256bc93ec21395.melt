Walking Through a Wasted Land, by Richard Thompson, from Across a Crowded
Room

A                        G   D
I'm walking through a wasted land
A                 G        D
The softs are concrete and busk
A                 G       D
Whatever happened to this country
F#m          E            D
Where is the hand you can trust
D    E     D    E     D    E
Walk Down, Walk Down, Walk Down

I remember when the farmer was ashamed
If he never put his hand to a plow
You can buy a lot of shame with your money
he'd riding in a limousine now

Walk Down, Walk Down, Walk Down


Now sweat is the name of this town
It's an ugly old dirty old disgrace
And now that the steel's shut down
It's steel puts the sweat in a man's face

Walk Down, Walk Down, Walk Down

Now I should have a break like you
But somebody stepped off the ditch
Heads are gonna roll someday
If we ever get this yoke off our necks.

Walk Down, Walk Down, Walk Down

Solo

Well I'm walking through a wasted land
I'm walking through a wasted land
Where is the future we planned?
I'm walking through a wasted land

Walk Down, Walk Down, Walk Down
