C              C
BUSTED FLAT IN BATON ROUGE,
C
HEADIN FOR THE TRAINS;
C             C           G7
FEELIN NEARLY FADED AS MY JEANS,
G7              G7
BOBBY THUMBED A DIESEL DOWN
G7             G7
JUST BEFORE IT RAINED;
G7              G7           C
TOOK US ALL THE WAY TO NEW ORLEANS.
C             C            C            C
I TOOK MY HARPON OUT OF MY DIRTY RED BANDANNA
                C         C7             F
AND WAS BLOWIN' SAD WHILE BOBBY SANG THE BLUES;
F             F                 F
_ _ WITH THEM WINDSHIELD WIPERS SLAPPIN TIME
    C               C
AND BOBBY'S CLAPPIN HANDS WE FINALLY
G7         G7               C
SANG EVERY SONG THAT DRIVER KNEW


F                F                 C           C
FREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR NOTHIN LEFT TO LOSE,
G7                  G7               C
NOTHIN' AIN'T WORTH NOTHIN' BUT IT'S FREE;
F                F               C              C
FEELIN' GOOD WAS EASY, LORD WHEN BOBBY SANG THE BLUES;
G7             G7              G7
AND FEELIN WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME,
G7              G7             C
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME AND BOBBY MCGEE


C            C                C
_ _ FROM THE COAL MINES OF KENTUCKY
       C          C
TO THE CALIFORNIA SUN,
C                C             G7
BOBBY SHARED THE SECRETS OF MY SOUL;
G7               G7
STANDIN' RIGHT BESIDE ME, LORD
G7                   G7
THROUGH EVERYTHING I DONE,
G7                  G7                C
AND EVERY NIGHT SHE KEPT ME FROM THE COLD.
C          C                C
_ _ _ THEN SOMEWHERE NEAR SALINAS, LORD,
  C             C
I LET HER SLIP AWAY
C               C7                 F
LOOKIN' FOR THE HOME I HOPE SHE'LL FIND;
F               F           F
_ AND I'D TRADE ALL OF MY TOMORROWS
      C
FOR A SINGLE YESTERDAY
G7             G7              C
HOLDIN BOBBY'S BODY NEXT TO MINE

F                F                 C           C
FREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR NOTHIN LEFT TO LOSE,
G7                  G7               C
NOTHIN' AIN'T WORTH NOTHIN' BUT IT'S FREE;
F                F               C              C
FEELIN' GOOD WAS EASY, LORD WHEN BOBBY SANG THE BLUES;
G7             G7              G7
AND FEELIN WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME,
G7              G7             C
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME AND BOBBY MCGEE

ME AND BOBBY MCGEE
BY KRIS KRISTOFFERSON

I am not sure which album this song is on, but I have always considered it
a classic.  I have been playing it this way for sometime, and it sounds OK.
I use a capo on the second fret so that the song can be played in the simple
keys of G and A.

                                                                Dwight

A
Busted flat in Baton Rouge and heading for the trains
                          E
feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
                          A
took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
                                        D
and was blowing sad while Bobby sang the Blues
with them windshield wipers slapping time
   A                               E                  A
and Bobby clapping hands we finally sang up every song that driver knew
D                               A
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose
E                                   A
Nothing ain't worth nothing but it's free
D                              A
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the Blues
E
Feeling good was good enough for me
                            A
good enough for me and Bobby McGee
B
&gt;From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
                              F#
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me Lord through everything I done
                                B
Every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away
                                    E
searching for the home I hope she'll find
                                    B
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
F#                          B
holding Bobby's body next to mine
E                               B
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose
F#                              B
Nothing left is all she left for me
E                              B
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the Blues
Buddy that was good enough for me
                            B
good enough for me and Bobby McGee
(Fade out with)
La de da de da de da da La de da de da
                        F#
La de da da me and Bobby McGee
La de da de da de da da La de da de da
                        B
La de da da me and Bobby McGee
