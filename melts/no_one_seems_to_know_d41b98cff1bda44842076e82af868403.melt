No One Seems To Know   by NEIL YOUNG

I figured out the chords to No One Seems To Know for guitar. F is not the
original key, but it's easiest to play on guitar. Use a capo to fit.
"X" refers to a chord I figured out, but couldn't find a name to.
Any suggestions welcome.

Cheers,
Wolfgang.F      Em           X
Once I was in love

                  B7      E
now it seems that time is better spent

    Am               F
in searching than in finding

    X              C       F
and noone seems to know         Em           X
so don't say you lose

               B7         E
don't say you lose, don't say you win

    Am              F
and noone else will know

      X         C        G
noone else will know


                                         C                  G
when you're down, you gather strength to leave the ground

                                            C
when you're high, it makes you weak and you fall back down.
