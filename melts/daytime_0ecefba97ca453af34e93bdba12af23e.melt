*from 'Back to Earth' (1978)*


Intro:

D  G (x3), Bm  A  G

Verse 1:

       D       G              D       G
In the daytime, time for cele-bration.
               D    G             Bm   A  G
No use lookin' down, if it's over here.

       D     G          D     G
It's a world, a new cre-ation.
        Em9                                   A                 E
And the golden light of the morning, makes it easy to comb your hair.
        G                 D         Esus4 E      D    G, D  G
And the love of the child; it's the time  of the year.

Verse 2:

       D       G               D        G
In the daytime, you can move a mountain.
       D                 G
With a blink of your eye;
              Bm                  A     G
Now it's over here, now it's over there.

       D     G               D       G
It's a world, with no compli-cations.
        Em9                           A                      E
And the curtains on the window, start blowing like your hair.
        G                D              Esus4 E      D    G, D  G
And the love that I feel, 'cos it's the time  of the year.

Middle 8:

Bm          A              G                  A
 Mysterious moon, found me cryin' in the dark;
Bm        A                       G, A
 Heard my footsteps on the stairs. 
Bm          A             G
 Mysterious moon found me cryin', but the sun,
         D      G         D     G
Dried my tears; showed he cares.

Instrumental:

D  G (x7), Bm  A  G

Verse 3:

       D       G              D       G
In the daytime, time for cele-bration.
               D    G                   Bm   A  G
No use lookin' down; children open your eyes.

       D     G        D      G
It's a world, a whole nation.
        Em9                              A            E
Now the white boats have landed, and the innocent are here.
   G             D                    Esus4 E      D
So dream for the child, 'cos it's the time  of the year.
