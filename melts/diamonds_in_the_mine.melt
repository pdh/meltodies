A                        G
The Woman in blue, she's asking for revenge

A                                    G
The man in white that's you, says he has no friends

A                             G
The river is swollen up with, rusty cans

A                                 E
And the trees are burning in your promised land



Chorus

D                               A
And there are no letters in the mailbox

D                                 A
And there are no grapes upon the vine

D                                  A
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore

                 E               A
And there are no diamonds in the mine


Verse 2
A                                      G
Well you tell me that your lover has a broken limb

A                                       G
You say your kinda restless now and it's on account of him

A                                     G
Well I saw the man in question it was just the other night

A                                 E
He was eating up a lady where the lions and christians fight

Chorus

D                               A
And there are no letters in the mailbox

D                                 A
And there are no grapes upon the vine

D                                  A
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore

                 E               A
And there are no diamonds in the mine


Verse 3
A                          G
There is no comfort in the covens of the witch

A                                G
Some very clever doctor went and sterilised the bitch

A                                   G
And the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride

A                                  E
He trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child

Chorus

D                               A
And there are no letters in your mailbox

D                                 A
And there are no grapes upon your vine

D                                  A
And there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore

                 E               A
And there are no diamonds in your mine
