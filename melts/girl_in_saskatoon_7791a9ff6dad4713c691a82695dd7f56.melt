Girl in Saskatoon

Intro: B  F#  B

B                             F#           B
I left a little town a little south of Hudson Bay
                                  C#               F#
I couldn't find a thing to make a rounder want to stay
  B                                 E                     B
I fought the wind across the barren waste and the crystal dunes
                       F#              B
Goin' for to marry the girl in Saskatoon
 
                            F#                  B
I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place 
                                      C#              F#
My heart was beatin' for her like the winter beat my face 
    B                                E                B
But knowin' that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June 
                                     F#            B
I'm freezin' but I'm burnin' for the girl in Saskatoon


A  E  A

                                 E             A
South and west and followin' the cold December sun 
                                      B              E         
I bedded down in the caragana when my daily trek was done
     A                             D                    A
Then up and pressin' onward by the light of the morning moon 
                            E            A
A prodigal returnin' to the girl in Saskatoon 


B  F#  B

                              F#                  B
Then I found a trail that had packed beneath the snow 
                                 C#              F#
I made the final miles where the prairie lilies grow 
  B                             E              B
A steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon 
                                     F#            B
I'm freezin' but I'm burnin' for the girl in Saskatoon 
                                    F#              B
But my journey was forgotten when I held her in my arms
                                C#              F#
My wonderlust was stifled by possession of her charms 
    B                                   E                  B
And kneeling neath the steeple where we couldn't wait till June 
                                F#            B
I found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon
