         E                     A
Darling, I can see the clouds around you
            B7                    E
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
                                      A
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you
          B7                     E
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose


        E       A                    E
Dearest love, I know your heart been shattered
           B7                 E
And all my words can offer no relief
       E         A                    E
But my love will heal the pain you've suffered
            B7                         E
And I'll be here if you should turn to me


         E                     A
Darling, I can see the clouds around you
            B7                    E
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
                                      A
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you
          B7                     E    B7   E
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose


   E                  A                E
In deepest night when memories tend to gather
         B7                       E
Lay with me and put your fears to sleep
                          A             E
'Cause there's no pain no dream can put asunder
         B7                        E
All the love that binds us you and me


         E                     A
Darling, I can see the clouds around you
            B7                    E
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
                                      A
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you
          B7                     E    
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
          B7                     E
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
