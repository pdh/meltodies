MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
Words and music by Hank Williams, Sr.

If the [D] wife and I are fussin', brother that's our right
'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight [D7]
Why don't you [G7] mind your own business
   (Mind [D] your own business)
'Cause if mind [A7] your business, then you won't be mindin' [D] mine.
