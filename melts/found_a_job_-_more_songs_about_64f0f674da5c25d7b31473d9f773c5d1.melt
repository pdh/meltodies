--- VERSE 1 ---
B5  A7                                       X                      
   "Damn that television, What a bad picture"!
D7                         A7                         
 Don't get upset, Its not a major disaster
A7
 "There's nothing on tonight", he said,
A7                 
 "I don't know what's the matter"
D7                                  A7
 "Nothings ever on", she said "so I don't know why you bother'
              

--- VERSE 2 ---
B5  A7                                                      X                      
   We've heard this little scene, we've heard it many times
D7                                      A7                         
 People fighting over little things and wasting precious time.
A7
 They might be better off 
A7                 
 I think the way it seems to me.
D7                                         A7
 Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V.


--- CHORUS ---
  E      A      E   G        E       A    E G
 Judy’s in the bed-room, in-venting situ-a-tions.
 E      D      E         D    E        A     E  G
 Bob is on the street to-day, scouting up lo-ca-tions.
 E          G      E         G
 They’ve en-listed all their family.
 E          G      E         F#  
 They’ve en-listed all their friends.
    B            D        B      D
 It helped saved their re-lation-ship,
     B       D    E
 And made it work again.


--- VERSE 3 ---
B5  A7                                                      X       
 Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit.
D7                                      A7                         
 There might even be a spin off, but they're not sure 'bout that.
A7
 If they ever watch T.V. again, 
A7
 it'd be too soon for them.
             D7                         A7
 Bob never yells about the picture now, he's having too much fun.



--- CHORUS ---
  E      A      E   G        E       A    E G
 Judy’s in the bed-room, in-venting situ-a-tions.

 They’ve en-listed all their friends.
    B            D        B      D
 It helped saved their re-lation-ship,
     B       D    E
 And made it work again.

B5  A7                                                      X    
  So think about this little scene; apply it to your life.
D7                                       A7                          
  If your work isn't what you love, then something isn't right.
A7
  Just look at Bob and Judy; 
A7 
  they're happy as can be,
D7                      A7
  Inventing situations, putting them on T.V.

 And made it work again.
