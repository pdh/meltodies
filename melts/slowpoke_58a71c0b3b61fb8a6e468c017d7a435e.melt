G
Something opened up
E7sus4   Em
the gates again,
G
I can't control it,
E7sus4            Em
so I rushed right in.
G
Here comes a mermaid
E7sus4      Em
and a little girl,
G
Saw open drawers
E7sus4         Em
from around the world.

G
I got some medals
E7sus4       Em           
hanging on my chest,
G
I've seen some good ones,
E7sus4           Em 
but I missed the rest.
G                   E7sus4 Em
Lady luck don't you turn on me,
G                          E7sus4 Em
I'm just a student of your hist  - ory,
G                          E7sus4 Em
I'm just a student of your hist  - ory,


G                  E7sus4  Em
Slowpoke I'm gonna run with you,
G
Wear all your clothes and
E7sus4     Em
do what you do.
G
Slowpoke
E7sus4               Em
we got some things to find,
G
When I was faster,
E7sus4      Em
I was always behind,
G
When I was faster,
E7sus4      Em
I was always behind.
