For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her Chords

Tuning: Standard (Capo 3rd fret)


D                  
What a dream I had
G                Em
Pressed in organdy
D
Clothed in crinoline
Cmj7
Of smoky burgundy
G         A
Softer than the rain


D
I wandered empty streets down
G                Em 
Past the shop displays
D
I heard cathedral bells
Cmj7
Dripping down the alleyways
G   A
As I walked on


D
And when you ran to me, your
G                        Em 
Cheeks flushed with the night
D
We walked on frosted fields
Cmj7
Of juniper and lamplight
G  A  
I held your hand



D
And when I awoke
G                     Em
And felt you warm and near
D
I kissed your honey hair
Cmj7
With my grateful tears
G            A
Oh, I love you girl
Cmj7 G A     Dsus4
Oh, I love you
