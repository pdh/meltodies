Chorus:
                    C         Am
Feel it in the one drop
F                             G
And we'll still find time to rap
                       C       Am
We're making the one stop
F                G
The generation gap
                    C           Am
So feel this drum beat
 F               G         
As it beats within
             C       Am
Playing a rhythm 
F                        G
resisting against the system
        C        Am               F
Ooh-we I know Jah'd never let us down
F                       G
Pull your rights from wrong
 C       Am              F
I know Jah'd never let us down
G
Oh no! oh no! oh no!

Verse:

C                        Am
They made the world so hard
  F                     G
Everyday the people are dying
 C                  Am        F            G
From hunger and starvation,          lamentation 
C                Am
But read it in Revelation
F                    G
You'll find your redemption
C                                            Am
And then you give us the teaching of His Majesty
       F                      G
For we no want no devil philosophy

Chorus:
                     C         Am
Feel it on the one drop   
F                          G
And we still find time to rap
                      C           Am
We're making the one stop
F                  G
And we fill in the gap
                   C          Am
So feel this drum beat
F             F        C               Am
As it beats within, playing a rhythm
F                         G
Fighting against ism and skism
