America Capo 2

C         C/B          Am        C/G        F
Let us be lovers we'll marry our fortunes together.
C             C/B         Am            Am
I've got some real estate here in my bag.

So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
       D      C      G         C  C/B  Am  C/G  F
And we walked off to look for America.


C       C/B        Am        C/G          F
Cathy I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
C        C/B          Am               Am
Michigan seems like a dream to me now 
G
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw 
D    G       D         Cmaj7  C
I've gone to look for America 


Bbmaj7                                     Cmaj7
Laughing on the bus playing games with the faces 
Bbmaj7                                       Cmaj7
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy 
F                     Fmaj7              C    C/B  Am  C/G  Am/F#  Fmaj7
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera 


C         C/B       Am              C/G       F
Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in my raincoat 
C             C/B         Am         Am
We smoked the last one an hour ago 
Em7                A7     Em7               A7
So I looked at the scenery she read her magazine 
        D    C    G       C  C/B    Am  C/G  F
And the moon rose over an open field 


C         C/B        Am        C/G          F
Cathy I'm lost I said though I knew she was sleeping
    C         C/B        Am               Am
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why 
G
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike 
        D   G       D         Cmaj7 C
They've all come to look for America 
D   G       D         Cmaj7 C
All come to look for America
D   G       D         Cmaj7
All come to look for America


C  C/B  Am7  C/G  Dm  Dm/C  G7/B  G7    Walk down pluck
