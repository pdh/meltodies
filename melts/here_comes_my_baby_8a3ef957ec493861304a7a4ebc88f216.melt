In the midnight moonlight I'll, be walking a long and lonely mile. 
    G  D  C    G D          C           D          G   D
And every time I do, I keep seeing this picture of you. 

D             G   D                G  D
Here comes my baby, here she comes now, 
D          G        D     C        D   C            D
And it can comes as no surprise to me, with another guy. 
              G   D                G   D
Here comes my baby, here she comes now, 
D              G            D           C      D
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine, 
C              D                     G    D
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.
 
G   D     C    G  D              C       D              G   D
You never walk alone, and you're forever talking on the phone. 
     G     D  C    G   D          C             D             G   D
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same. 

D             G   D                G  D
Here comes my baby, here she comes now, 
D          G        D     C        D   C            D
And it can comes as no surprise to me, with another guy.

Here comes my baby, here she comes now, 
D              G            D           C      D
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,

Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

I'm still waiting for your heart, cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start. 
          G    D  C    G    D         C                  D              G   D
You'll be mine to hold each day, but 'till then, this is all that I can say.

Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
