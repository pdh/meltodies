Intro:
A



A
Leaves were falling just like embers
                                      D
In colors red and gold they set us on fire
                    A
Burning just like a moonbeam ..in our eyes




Chorus:
E
Somebody said they saw me
D
Swinging the world by the tail
                      A       E
Bouncing over a white cloud.
            A
Killing the Blues



A
I am guilty of something
                                     D
I hope you never do because there is nothing
            A
Sadder than losing .. yourself in love




(Repeat Chorus 2x)



A
Now, you ask me Just to leave you
                                        D
To go out on my own and get what I need to
               A
You want me to find what I've already had



(Repeat Chorus 4x)
