"The Most Unoriginal Sin" by John Hiatt (as performed by Willie Nelson on
"Across the Borderline" CD).

D                 A
What there was left of us
                                                  D
Was all covered in dust and thick skin
     A
A half eaten apple

Or the whole Sistine Chapel
                                     D
Painted on the head of a pin
    G
A life long love's worth

Gone up in a smurk
                                                 D
And you didn't even see her waltz in
             G
Now this love is a ghost

Having played host
                                   D
To the most unoriginal sin


           A
At the wedding we smiled
                                               D
While some devil played wild violin
A
Soon after the chapel

She offered me that apple
                                                    D
One bite and I was gone with the wind
               G
And you needed no proof

Cause the whole naked truth
                                             D
Was wearing only an infidel's grin
            A
And a proud schoolboy's boast

Of having left his post
                                   D
For the most unoriginal sin

INSTRUMENTAL  D/G/D/A/D x2

               A
Now the jukebox is humming
                                              D
All the venial shortcomings of men
          A
Lord I found me this drink

That can finally sink
                                                       D
All the skills that I've been wallowing in
            G
Buddy once you get started

Once true love's departed
                                     D
You do it over and over again
         A
So tonight I will toast

Just whoever comes close
                                  D
To the most unoriginal sin.
