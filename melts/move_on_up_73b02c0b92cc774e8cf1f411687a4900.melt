                             Curtis Mayfield - Move on up
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tabbed by: ClassicManiac


Basically there is only one progression played all the way through: Em - A - Bm - F#m

A and F#m are played quickly between changing from Em to Bm (which means, if you're
a beginner and your fingers are not yet fast enough, you could also keep playing Em - Bm).
Just listen to the song, you're gonna get a feeling for it quickly.



F#m      Em
Hush now child,
    A         Bm
and don't you cry
F#m       Em
Your folks might understand you
A      Bm
by and by
     F#m     Em
Just move on up
             A    Bm
towards your destination
       F#m     Em
Though you may find

from time to time
A     Bm        F#m
Complications

Em - A - Bm - F#m - Em - A - Bm

F#m        Em (...)
Bite your lip
and take a trip
Though there may be
wet road ahead
You cannot slip
Just move on up
and peace you will find
Into the steeple
of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind

So hush now child
and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you
by and by
Move on up
and keep on wishing
Remember your dream
is your only scheme
So keep on pushing

Take nothing less
Ain't no second best
Do not obey
you must have your say
That you can past the test

Just move on up
Just move on up to a greater day
With just a little faith
if you put your mind to it
You can surely do it

Just move on up
Move on up
What move on up
Oh child but just a move on up
Just move on up
Move on up

Just move on up
Move on up
What move on up
Oh child but just a move on up
Just move on up
Move on up
