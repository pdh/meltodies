Intro:
G Bm G Bm
  G                            Bm
I used to watch Highway Patrol whittlin' with my knife
        G                              Bm
but the thought never struck me I'd be black and white for life
      G                              Em
I was raised on law and order in a community of strife
  D                            Am                  C   Am   C   Am
became a restless border and I never took a wife
       G                   Bm
I went looking for Khadafi aboard Air Force One
      G                          Bm
but I never did find him and the CIA said son
       G                     Em
you'll never be a hero, your flying days are done
     D                                     Am                     C Am C Am
it's time for you to go home now, stop sniffin that smoking gun
      
      G                                Bm
I was travellin with my family through the mideast late one night
       G                            Bm
in the hotel all was quite the kids were out like little lights
         G                                        Em
then the street filled with jeeps there was an explosion to the right
     D                                Am                   C Am C Am     
they chanted "death to America" I was feelin like a fight

     G                       Bm 
So I ran down the stairs and out into the street
        G                      Bm
someone kicked me in the belly someone else kissed my feet
      G                  Em
I was Rambo in the disco shooting to the beat
     D                             Am                   C Am C Am
When they burned me in effigy my vacation was complete
