               A                    E7            A
Well, They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to  be good
                      E7                  A      A7
They'll stone ya just like they said the would
         D                   Bb7b9   A7       D
They'll stone ya when you're tryin to go home
              A                   E7         A    A7
Then they'll stone ya when you're there all alone
      E7                         
But I would not feel so all alone
   A          E7       A
If Everybody must get stoned


more lyrics:

They'll stone ya when you're walkin' along the street
They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to keep your seat
They'll stone ya when you're walkin' on the floor
They'll stone ya when you're walkin' to the door
But I would not feel so all alone
If Everybody must get stoned

They'll stone ya when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone ya when you are young and able
They'll stone ya when you're tryin to make a buck
They'll stone ya then say good luck
But i would not feel so all alone
If Everybody must get stoned

They'll stone ya and say that it's the end
They'll stone ya and come back again
They'll stone ya when you're ridin' in your car
They'll stone ya whe you're playin your guitar
But I would not feel so all alone
If Everybody must get stoned

They'll stone ya when you walk all alone
They'll stone ya when you are walkin' home
They'll stone ya and say you are brave
They'll stone ya when you're set down in your grave
But i would not feel so all alone
If Everybody must get stoned!
