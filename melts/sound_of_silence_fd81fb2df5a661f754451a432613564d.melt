Simon and Garfunkel - The Sound of Silence

Standard tuning
                                           Dm
Throughout the intro you pluck like so: e|---1---1---1---1-|
                                        B|-----3-------3---|
                                        G|-2-------2-------|

The only plucking part of the song is the intro, the rest is strumming, you'll have
to listen to the song to find the rhythm. Good luck.


Intro: (Start plucking on the 'G' string, and say "Hello" on the third time you pluck
the 'B' string. The rest of the chords are above the corresponding syllables, just keep
the plucking rhythm while you transition.)

Dm                        C
    Hello darkness my old friend
                           Dm
I've come to talk with you again
          F          Bb      F
Because a vision softly creeping
                       Bb       F
Left his seeds while I was sleeping
        Bb                            F
And the vision that was planted in my brain
               Dm   F            C        D          
Still remain          within the sound of silence.


Verse 1:
                             C
In restless dreams I walked alone
                          Dm
Narrow streets of cobbled stone
           F       Bb       F
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                          Bb       F
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        Bb                                       F
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                       Dm   F                 C        Dm
That split the night          and touched the sound of silence.


Verse 2:
                         C
And in the naked light I saw
                          Dm
Ten thousand people maybe more
       F           Bb       F
People talking without speaking
                   Bb        F
People hearing without listening
               Bb                      F
People writing songs that voices never share 
                  Dm   F             C        Dm
And no one dare          disturb the sound of silence


Verse 3:
                        C
Fools said I you do not know
                      Dm
Silence like a cancer grow
        F            Bb          F
Hear my words that I might teach you
                   Bb          F
Take my arm that I might reach you
       Bb                          F
But my words like silent raindrops fell
Dm       F             C       Dm
     And echoed in the well of silence


Verse 4:
                         C
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Dm
To the neon god they made
        F                Bb      F
And the sign flashed out its warning
                     Bb      F
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said 
    Bb                                              F
The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
                     Dm       F                C        Dm
And tenement halls        and whispered in the sound of silence


Enjoy,
Todd
