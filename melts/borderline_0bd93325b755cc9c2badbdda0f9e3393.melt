   C                                                                      G
As usual you just wouldn't listen waitin' for your turn to talk while I explain
   G                                                                            C
You just wouldn't stop and listen so you got your heart run over by a mystery train
    C                                                          F
I tried to warn you from the start you must be careful of my kind


   C       ///   F      ///      G            C
Not quite crazy not quite sane right on the borderline


   C                                                                  G
How many times I told you it's got nothin' to do with you why can't you see
   G                                                              C
But there's a difference in our music you've got yours but mine's got me
    C                                                          F
I stay up day and night for nothin' puttin' words on paper I can't find


   C       ///   F      ///      G            C
Not quite crazy not quite sane right on the borderline


   C                                                  G
It's a musical whodunit you know how people love a mystery
   G                                                      C
There ain't no knot untangable the only thing unchangeable is me
    C                                                          F
So if you're gonna stay get ready to go through this from time to time


 
   C       ///          F      ///      G            C

   C                                                  G
