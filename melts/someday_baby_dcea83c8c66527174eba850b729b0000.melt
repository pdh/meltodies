Again the blues,as always you figure the strumming pattern,shouldn't be hard.
Listen to the track for chords timing,and this is the little lick repeating after
each line.

Bb  
I don't care what you do, I don't care what you say
Eb                                        Bb
I don't care where you go or how long you stay
        F                     Eb               Bb
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore
