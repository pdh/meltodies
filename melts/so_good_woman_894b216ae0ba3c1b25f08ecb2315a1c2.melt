                             E             B
	The way i am is the way i'll always be

	No all around all of my life
          E
	You could have done better 'cause you've been a good wife

	You're so good looking,Lord you could have done better than me

	You're so good looking, you know could have done better than me
          B
	Look at the men, looking at you
          E
	While you're looking at me and i'm happy you do
                B                              E                     B

          B
	Look at the men, looking at you
         E
	But you're looking at me Lord i'm happy you do
                B                              E                     B
	You're so good looking,Lord you could have done better than me

                                         E                 B
	And you're so good woman you're just too good for me
