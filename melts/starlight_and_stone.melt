INTRO: A  E  A  E  A

                E                        A
I just wanted a ride, I just want you to know
                 E                      A
I got nothin' to hide, I got nowhere to go
                  E                    A
And the hunger is hard as a promise to keep
                      E                       A
And the nights are so long and the silence so deep

BRIDGE:
                   D                    A
In the piece of my mind the world can't erase
               E                         A
I remember the time and the look on your face
                    D                             A
And I will 'til the wind blows the stars from the sky
                       E                      A
'Cause the road never ends and the soul never dies

           E                       A
Be who you are just as long as you can
             E                     A        E
Know in your heart, I'm still your man
            A        E
Headin' for home
              A
Starlight and stone
