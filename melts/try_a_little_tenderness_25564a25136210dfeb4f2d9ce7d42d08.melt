Intro:

G, Adim  C/E  G7/F  C/E  G/E  C#dim  D

Verse 1:

G    Em
 Oh, she may be weary;
Am                D7
 Them young girls, they do get weary,
G             F6              E7
 Wearing that same old shaggy dress.
Am                       D7
 But when she gets weary;
             G/B        Bb7, Am  Am/D
Try a little tenderness.

Verse 2:

G          Em            Am       D7
 You know, she's waiting; just an-ticipating,
Gmaj7                  F6            E7
 The thing that she'll never, never, never, never posses, yeah, yeah.
Am                             D7
 But while she's there waiting, and without them,
             Gmaj7      C       G                 G7
Try a little tenderness, that's all you got to do.

Bridge:

C              B7
 It's not just sentimental, no, no, no;
Em           A7
 She has her griefs and cares.
C                    B7
 But the soft words; they are spoke so gentle, yeah,
A7                  Am7        D7
 It makes it easier, easier to bear.

Verse 3:

G    Em
 You won't regret it, no, no;
Am                 D7
 Young girls, they, don't forget it;
G              F6          E7
 Love is their whole happi-ness.
Am                   D7
 But its all so easy;
                                       G/B
All you got to do is try, try a little tenderness yeah.
              E7
All you gotta, do is dance, and hold her where you want her.
