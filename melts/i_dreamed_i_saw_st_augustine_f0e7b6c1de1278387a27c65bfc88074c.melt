Bob Dylan - I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine
Album: John Wesley Harding (12/27/1967)

Intro: F    Bb  F  
F                             Bb
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
Bb                 F
Alive as you or me,
F                         
Tearing through these quarters
  Gm                Bb
In the utmost misery,
      F
With a blanket underneath his arm
     Bb                   
And a coat of solid gold,
F         Em      Dm   C
Searching for the very souls
       Bb         Gm   F
Whom already have been sold.

F
"Arise, arise," he cried so loud,
     Bb                  F
In a voice without restraint,
F
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
    Gm               Bb
And hear my sad complaint.
   F
No martyr is among ye now
     Bb
Whom you can call your own,
Bb    F       Em     Dm     C
So go on your way accordingly
C   Bb          Gm    F
But know you're not alone."

F
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
  Bb               F
Alive with fiery breath,
F
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
     Gm              Bb
That put him out to death.
Bb  F         
Oh, I awoke in anger,
F   Bb               
So alone and terrified,
Bb F     Em      Dm          C
I put my fingers against the glass
C   Bb        Gm       F
And bowed my head and cried.
