Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream
1950 by E.McCURDY

     G                                 C    D7        G
Last night I had the strangest dream I ever dreamed before
  D                     G    E        C      D7     G
I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war.
  C               G                C        D7          G
I dreamed I saw a mighty room, the room was filled with men.
        C               G       Hm          C     D7    G
And the paper they were signing said they'd never fight again.


    G                                     C       D7     G
And when the papers all were signed and a million copies made
     D                    G           E         C        D7
They all joined hands and bowed their heads and greatful prayers were
G
prayed
        C             G                  C       D7        G
And the people in the streets below were dancing round and round
    C                   G  Hm         C         D7     G
And Guns and swords and uniforms were scattered on the ground.


       G                                 C  D7          G
Last night I had the strangest dream I ever dreamed before
  D                     G    E        C      D7     G
I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war.
