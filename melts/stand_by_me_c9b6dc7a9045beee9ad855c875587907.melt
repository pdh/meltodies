C                       Am
when the night has come,   and the land is dark
        F           G              C
and the moon is the only light we see
C                             Am
No I won’t, be afraid, ohhh I won’t be afraid
        F            G               C
just as long, as you stand, stand by me


CHORUS:
C                                     Am
so darlin darlin stand by me,   oh oh stand by me
   F       G             C
oh stand,    stand by me,  stand by me


C                       Am
if the sky we look upon,   should tumble and fall
       F                 G               C
or the mountains, should crumble, to the sea
C                            Am
i wont cry, i wont cry, no i wont shed a tear
        F            G               C
just as long, as you stand, stand by me

   F       G             C
