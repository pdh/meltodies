One of the easier Ween songs to play, but still a favourite of mine.
Mostly two chords (C, D). Shoulda' figured it out way sooner.

Fat Lenny's gonna walk right into mahself
Fat Lenny's gonna see mahself (reflect it back on myself)
Fat Lenny's gonna lick the shilack off the window sill
and I said Fat Lenny's gonna lick my hand off

(you talkin' about my friend Fat Lenny)
(i like him alot)
(you talkin' about my buddy Gener)
(yep Fat Lenny)

Fat Lenny's gonna lick the shilack off the window sill and I said now
Fat Lenny's gonna jump up + down (run on back down the hill)
Fat Lenny's knows what he is (to be Fat Lenny) cuz he is Fat Lenny (my buddy)
He's Fat Lenny (my friend is) today Fat Lenny...

Fat Lenny's gonna lick my brain today
Fat Lenny doesn't like me anyway
Fat Lenny (my friend is) today Fat Lenny, Fat Lenny, Fat Lenny ...
