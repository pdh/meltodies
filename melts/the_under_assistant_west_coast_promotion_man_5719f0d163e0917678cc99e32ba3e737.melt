The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man chords
The Rolling Stones

G

         G
Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A. 
         C7                                    G
Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A. 
             D7             C7                G
But I'd much rather be on a boardwalk on Broadway 

         G
Well I'm sitting here thinkin' just how sharp I am 
         C7                                     G
Well I'm sitting here thinkin' just how sharp I am 
       D7              C7               G
I'm an under assistant West Coast promo man 

       G                  
Well I promo groups when they come into town 
       C7                               G
Well I promo groups when they come into town 
          D7                          C7             G
Well they laugh at my toupee, they're sure to put me down 

         G
Well I'm sitting here thinkin' just how sharp I am 
         C7                                     G
Well I'm sitting here thinkin' just how sharp I am 
      D7               C7                         G
I'm a necessary talent behind every rock and roll band 

         
Yeah, I'm sharp 
                   C7
I'm really, really sharp 
                  G
I sure do earn my pay 
                           C7   G
Sitting on the beach every day, yeah 

I'm real real sharp, yes I am 
I got a Corvette and a seersucker suit 
Yes I have 

Here comes the bus, uh oh 
I though I had a dime 
Where's my dime 
I know I have a dime somewhere 
I'm pretty sure........
