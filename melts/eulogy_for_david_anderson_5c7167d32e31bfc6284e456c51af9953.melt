                             EULOGY FOR DAVID ANDERSON - Ween
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tabbed by: Russell Pinkston
Email: russ@projectdomino.com

Tuning: Standard

This is such a great song, I had to tab it out. It's off of the Caesar Demos, some 
unreleased tracks from the Quebec era.
This tab is probably not 100% perfect, but it's as close as my ears can get it 
(including a few of the lyrics).
Let me know of any corrections.

Enjoy.

Eb7 G#
Walk in, I'm away.
F Bb Eb7 G# C# Bb7
I'm a long time gone and then the bomb.

Eb7 G#
What's that? Who said?
F Bb Eb7 G# C# Bb7
How many days? Just what the hell is going on?

Eb7 G#
Oh, dude.
Eb7(2) G# F F C# Bb7
Not you, my friend.

Eb7 G#
It's been a while since you've been gone.
F Bb Eb7 G# C# Bb7
Still don't understand why you left us and a son.

Eb7 G#
I'm alright. I'm still drunk.
F Bb Eb7 G# C# Bb7
Just so you know, I eat the Indian and watch Simpsons.

Eb7 G#
Oh, dude.
Eb7(2) G# F F C# Bb7
Not you, my friend.

Eb7 G#
You'll be missed. Still on...
F Bb Eb7 G# C# Bb7
the bus. Not ever the same since you've been gone.

Eb7 G#
I miss you. You know that.
F Bb Eb7 G# C# Bb7
So with my days, I just go on and on and on.

Eb7 G#
Oh, dude.
Eb7(2) G# F F C# Bb7
Not you, my friend.
