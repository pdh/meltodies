VERSE 1                                         
    G            D
They ask me how I feel,
    D            C
And if my love is real.
    C                   G
And how I know I'll make it through.
    G                    D
And they, they look at me and frown,
     D                   C
They'd like to drive me from this town,
     C             G
They don't want me around,
G           D       C
Cause I believe in you.

VERSE 2
    G              D
They show me to the door,
    D                   C
They say don't come back no more.
      C                       G
Cause I don't be like they'd like me to,
    G              D
And I walk out on my own.
    D              C
A thousand miles from home,
   C             G
But I don't feel alone,
G          D      G
Cause I believe in you.

VERSE 3
        G               D                            C
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter.
      G            D              C
I believe in you even though we be apart.
      G            D              C
I believe in you even on the morning after.
G          D            C
Oh, when the dawn is nearing.
G          D            C
Oh, when the night is disappearing.
G               D                      C
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.


VERSE 4
    G              D
Don't let me drift too far,
    D            C
Keep me where you are.
    C                   G
Where I will always be renewed.
    G                   D
And that which you've given me today,
    D                   C
Is worth more than I could pay,
    C                G
And no matter what they say,
G      D       C
I believe in you.

VERSE 5
      G             D                   C
I believe in you when winter turns to summer,
      G             D                   C
I believe in you when white turns to black,
      G             D                   C
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered.
G             D               C
Oh, though the earth may shake me.
G             D              C
Oh, though my friends forsake me.
G               D                C
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.

VERSE 6
     G                D
Don't let me change my heart,
  D         C
Keep me set apart,
    C                   G
From all the plans they do pursue.
      G              D
And I, I don't mind the pain,
     D               C
Don't mind the driving rain.
    C          G
I know I will sustain,
   G     D        C
Cause I believe in you.
