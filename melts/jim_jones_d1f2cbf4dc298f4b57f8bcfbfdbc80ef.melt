           G
Come and listen for a moment, lads,
                      C
And hear me tell my tale.
      G                   D
How across the sea from England
  C                 G
I was condemned to sail.
         G
Now the jury found me guilty,
                         C
Then says the judge, says he,
           G                    D
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
  C                G
Across the stormy sea.
     C
But take a tip before you ship
     G
To join the iron gang.
       C
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay,
    G                  D
Or else you'll surely hang.
    G
Or else you'll surely hang," says he.
                      C
"And after that, Jim Jones,
      G                  D
It's high above on the gallows tree
      C                   G
The crows will pick your bones."

G
And our ship was high upon the sea
                   C
Then pirates came along,
          G               D
But the soldiers on our convict ship
      C                   G
Were full five hundred strong.

For they opened fire and somehow drove
                   C
That pirate ship away.
          G                      D
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
     C             G
Tan gone to Botany Bay.
           C             G
With the storms ragin' round us,
          C              G
And the winds a-blowin' gale,
     G                      D
I'd rather have drowned in misery
      C                 G
Than gone to New South Wales.


Now it's day and night and the irons clang,
                      C
And like poor galley slaves
    G                     D
We toil and toil, and when we die
      C                G
Must fill dishonored graves,
          G
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains,
                         C
Well, into the bush I'll go
           G               D
And I'll join the bravest rankers there,
C                G
Jack Donohue and co.
     C                    G
And some dark night, when everything
    C             G
Is silent in the town
                          D
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all,
      C                  G
I'll gun the flogger down.
         C                  G
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock,
C                G
Remember what I say,
                                D
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
    C                G
In chains to Botany Bay.
