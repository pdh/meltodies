THERE'LL BE NO TEARDROPS TONIGHT
by Hank Williams
 
C                           G7
I'll pretend I'm free from sorrow
                           C
Make believe that wrong is right
                 C7       F
Your wedding day will be tomorrow
             C     G7          C
But There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight
 
        F                C
Why  oh why should you desert me
        F              G7
Are you doing this for spite
       C    C7           F
If you only want to hurt me
              C     G7         C
Then There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight
 
                             G7
I'll believe that you still love me
                           C
When you wear your veil of white
                   C7          F
But you think that you're above me
            C     G7        C
So There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight
 
         F                      C
Shame oh shame  for what you're doing
      F                  G7
Other arms will hold you tight
          C         C7        F
You don't care whose life you ruin
             C     G7        C
But There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight
