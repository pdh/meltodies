A                       E
Why do you stand by the window
D                       A
Abandoned to beauty and pride
A                              E
The thorn of the night in your bosern
D                           A
The spear of the age in you side
A                    E
Lost in the rages of fragrance
D                   A
Lost in the rags of remorse
A                      E
Lost in the waves of a sickness
D                            A
That loosens the high silver nerves

Chorus:

E
O chosen love, O frozen love
D                      A
O tangle of matter and ghost
E
O darling of angels, demons and saints
D                            A
And the whole broken-hearted host
A           E
Gentle this soul

And come forth from your cloud of unknowing
kiss the cheek of the moon
The new Jerusalem glowing
Why tarry all night in this ruin
And leave no word of discomfort
Or leave no observer to mourn
But climb on your tears and be silent
Like the rose on its ladder of thorn

Chorus

Then lay your rose on the fire
The fire give up to the sun
The sun give over to splendor
In the arms of the High Holy One
For The Holy One dreams of a letter
And he Dreams of a letter's  death
Oh bless the continuous stutter
Of the word being made into flesh

Chorus

MfG Tobi
