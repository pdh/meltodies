Like A Rolling Stone by Bobby Dylan

intro
A      D (several times)

Verse

A                Bm
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
    C#m                    D              E
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
A                Bm
People'd call, say, "Beware doll,
      C#m                        D              E
you're bound to fall, You thought they were all, kiddin' you

Bridge

D             E
You used to laugh about
D                E
Everybody that was hangin' out
D       C#m   Bm           C
Now you don't talk so loud
D        C#m  Bm           C
Now you don't seem so proud

D                                             E
About having to be scrounging for your next mealllllll...

Chorus
                   
How does it     feel? A  D  E
E                     A  D  E
How does it     feel
E                     A  D  E
To be without a home
E                      A  D  E
Like a complete unknown
E                     A  D  E
Like a rolling  stone?
