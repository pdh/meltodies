Verse 1: 

Am7                                             
The world is turning, I hope it don't turn away
Dm                                         Am7
The world is turning, I hope it don't turn away
Cm7                         F
     All my pictures are falling....
Cm7                                   F
     From the wall where I placed them yesterday
Am7                                   Dm   Am7
The world is turning, I hope it don't turn away


Verse 2: 

Am7
I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day
Dm                                                     Am7     
I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day
Cm7                          F
    Though my problems are meaningless
Cm7                          F
    That don't make them go away
Am7                                             Dm7    Am
I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day

Verse 3: 

Am7
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
Dm                                                             Am7
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
Cm7                         F
    Now I'm living out here on the beach
Cm7                         F
    But those seagulls are still out of rach
Am7                                                        Dm     Am7
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone

Am7
Get outta town, I think I'll get outta town

Get outta town, I think I'll get outta town
Cm7                               F
    I head for the sticks with my bus and friends
Cm7                               F
    I follow a road I don't know where it ends

Get outta town, I think I'll get outta town
