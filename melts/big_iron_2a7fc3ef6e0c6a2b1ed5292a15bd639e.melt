Am...Em...Am

       |C                                         |Am
To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
       |C                                                |Am
Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say
       |F                               |C
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
                                          |Am
for the stranger there amongst them had a big iron on his hip
|F              |C
Big iron on his hip


       |C                                         |Am
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
        |C                                            |Am
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
        |F                                |C
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
                                           |Am
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
|F              |C
big iron on his hip


        |C                                              |Am
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
     |C                                               |Am
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
       |F                            |C
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
                                       |Am
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more
|F               |C
One and nineteen more


        |C                                              |Am
Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
       |C                                     |Am
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town
        |F                          |C
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
                                    |Am
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
|F          |C
After Texas Red
        |C                                         |Am
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
        |C                                             |Am
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
       |F                           |C
Twenty men had tried to take twenty men had made a slip
                                        |Am
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
|F              |C
Big iron on his hip


    |C                                                |Am
The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
       |C                                             |Am
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
           |F                                |C
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath
                                   |Am
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
|F                |C
About to meet his death


          |C
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their
|Am
play
        |C                                               |Am
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day
      |F                                 |C
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
                                        |Am
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
|F              |C
Big iron on his hip


       |C                                          |Am
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
      |C                                            |Am
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
      |F                               |C
Oh he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip
                                           |Am
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
|F              |C
Big iron on his hip

Big iron Big iron
        |C                                 |Am
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
