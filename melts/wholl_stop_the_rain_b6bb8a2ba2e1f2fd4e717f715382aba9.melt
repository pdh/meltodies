G                       C               G
Long as I remember, the rain been comin down.
                  Bm         C             G
Clouds of mystery pourin, confusion on the ground.
C                    G     C                  G
Good men through the ages, trying to find the sun;
C             D               Em              G
And I wonder, still I wonder, who ll stop the rain?

G                             C                G
I went down Virginia, seeking shelter from the storm.
                 Bm       C                 G
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow.
C                   G          C                 G
Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains.
C             D               Em              G
And I wonder, still I wonder, who ll stop the rain?

C G D  Am C Em  D/G

G                          C                  G
Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more.
                       Bm      C              G
The crowd had rushed together, trying to keep warm.
C                   G       C             G
Still the rain kept pourin, falling on my ears.
C             D               Em              G
And I wonder, still I wonder, who ll stop the rain?
