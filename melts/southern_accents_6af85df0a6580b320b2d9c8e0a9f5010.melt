E ------------------------------|

[A]There's a [F#m]sout[E]hern [A]accent - where [F#m]I c[E]ome [A]from
The [F#m]young 'uns [E]call it [A]country - the [D]yankees call it [E]dumb,
I got my [F#m]own [E]way of [A]talking - but [D]everything gets [E]done,
With a [F#m]sout[E]hern [D]accent - where I come from.[A(INTRO RIFF)]


Now that [F#m]drunk tank [E]in At[A]lanta - is just a [F#m]motel r[E]oom to
[A]me,
Think I [F#m]might go w[E]ork Or[A]lando - if them [D]orange groves don't
[E]freeze,
Got my [F#m]own [E]way of [A]working - but [D]everything is [E]run,
With a [F#m]sout[E]hern [D]accent - where I come from.[A(INTRO RIFF)]


{C:bridge:}
[F#m]For just a minute there [D]I was dreaming
[F#m]For just a minute it was [D]all so real
[B]For just a minute she was [E]standing[A]there - with [D]me.
                                                       [A(INTRO RIFF)]

There's a [F#m]dream [E]I keep [A]having - where my [F#m]momma [E]comes to
[A]me,
And [F#m]kneels down [E]over by the [A]window - and [D]says a prayer for
[E]me,
Got my [F#m]own [E]way of [A]praying - but [D]everything one's [E]begun,
With a [F#m]sout[E]hern [A]accent - where[D] I come [E]from.

Got my [F#m]own [E]way of [A]living - but e[D]verything is [E]done,
With a [F#M]sout[E]hern [D]accent - where I come from.[A(INTRO RIFF)]
