C                       F               G7
Down every road there's always one more city
    F              G7            C
I'm on the run the highway is my home
                  F               G7
I raised a lot of cane back in my younger days
      F            G7                  C
While Mama used to pray my crops would fail
                 F                      G7
Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways
   F              G7               C
Outrun the law or spend my life in jail
 
                   F                   G7
I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
  F                          G7
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
     C                  F               G7
Down every road there's always one more city
    F              G7            C
I'm on the run the highway is my home
 
                 F                G7
I'm lonely but I can't afford the luxury
   F            G7           C
Of having one I love to come along
                   F               G7
She'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
    F              G7           C
For he who travels fastest goes alone
tag:
    F              G7            C
I'm on the run the highway is my home
