VERSE 1
G                       D
Through the corridors of sleep

        C               G
Past the shadows dark and deep

D                       C           G    C  G
My mind dances and leaps in confusion.

G                       D
I dont know what is real,

        C               G
I can't touch what I feel

        D               C               G
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion.

CHORUS:

D       C               G       G/F# Em
So I'll continue to continue to pre- tend

   Am               Em
My life will never end,

    A             C
And flowers never bend

         Opening Riff
With the rainfall.

VERSE 2

G               D
The mirror on my wall

        C               G
Casts an image dark and small

D                 C                 G         C  G
But Im not sure at all its my reflection.

G               D
I am blinded by the light

 C                     G
Of God and truth and right

        D         C                     G         C  G
And I wander in the night without direction.

CHORUS

D       C               G       G/F# Em
So I'll continue to continue to pre- tend

   Am               Em
My life will never end,

    A             C
And flowers never bend

         Opening Riff
With the rainfall.

VERSE 3:

     G                  D
Its no matter if youre born

        C               G
To play the king or pawn

      D         C                       G         C  G
For the line is thinly drawn tween joy and sorrow,

G       D
So my fantasy

 C          G
Becomes reality
        D               C               G         C  G
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow.

CHORUS

D       C               G       G/F# Em
So I'll continue to continue to pre- tend

   Am               Em
My life will never end,

    A             C
And flowers never bend

         Opening Riff
With the rainfall.
