The Lonesome River by Bob Dylan and Ralph Stanley

A                                      
I sit here alone on the banks of the river
                  D                        A
The lonseome wind blows and the water runs high
                    D                            A
I can hear a voice call [from] out there in the darkness
               E                      A
But I sit here alone too lonesome to cry


chorus
A
Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight

I sit on the shore to grievin'  and to cry

The woman I love she left me this morning
               E                        A
With no-one to love or kiss me goodnight




We met there one night on the banks of the river
sat there holdin' hands and makin' a vow
That we never would part and be happy together
But a new love she's found - she's gone with him now.




Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight
I sit on the shore to grievin' and to cry
The woman I love she left me this morning
With no-one to love or kiss me goodnight
