Just Like A Woman chords
Bob Dylan

C F G C  C F G C

C      F     G   C
Nobody feels any pain,
           F      G        C
tonight is lost inside the rain
F         G
Ev'rybody knows,
     F              G
that Baby's got new clothes
    F   Em Dm C       G
But lately I  see her ribbons and her bows,
     Am     C    F   G
have fallen from her curls.

    C     Em   Dm     F
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
    C          Em   Dm     F
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
        C     Em   Dm     F
And she aches just like a woman
        G                         C
But she breaks just like a little girl.

C           F     G  C
Queen Mary, she's my friend,
                    F      G    C
yes, I believe I'll go see her again
F             G
Nobody has to guess, 
F                  G
that Baby can't be blessed
     F   Em      Dm   C    G
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest;
         Am       C           F       G
with her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.

    C     Em   Dm     F
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
    C          Em   Dm     F
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
        C     Em   Dm     F
And she aches just like a woman
        G                         C
But she breaks just like a little girl.

       E7
It was raining from the first,

and I was dying there of thirst;
     C
so I came in here
         E7
And your long-time curse hurts,
          
but what's worse,
        F
is this pain in here
        G
I can't stay in here;

ain't it clear that

C F    G     C
I just can't fit
                    F        G     C
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
F             G
When we meet again,
F             G
introduced as friends;
F      Em    Dm  C  G
please don't let on that you knew me when,
      Am                C  F G
I was hungry and it was your world.

        C    Em   Dm     F
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
    C         Em   Dm     F
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
         C    Em   Dm     F
Then you ache just like a woman
        G                        C
But you break just like a little girl.
