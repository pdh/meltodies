Always On My Mind
-----------------
by Willie Nelson

I:
D              A
Maybe I didn't love you
Bm       D          G            A
Quite as often as I could have
D                  A
And maybe I didn't treat you
Bm       D         Em7
Quite as good as I should have

II:
G                  D
If I made you feel second best
G         D           Em
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
A            Bm     A7    D     Em    F#m
But you were always on my mind
G        A7           D     G     A
You were always on my mind

(same progression as I)
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

(same progression as II)
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

D     A  Bm    D
Tell     me
G                 D                 Em    G    A7
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
D     A  Bm
Give     me
D       G                  D              Em
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
     A             D
I'll keep you satisfied
