hi everybody, it's such a great song i'm really suprised nobody hasn't tabbed it yet
well actulally the song is played with bass not always playing the tonics so
if you see a C/F indication and you play guitar alone you may choose playing
it as just a C chord or a C chord with an F in the bass. choose it as you
like.  and if you have a dude playing bass so play just the original chords
and tell him (or her ;) to play the bass notes written after the dash, or if
there is no dash - the tonics

C/F Bb/F Am F Am C F

     F                         C
When love comes so late, it'll really hit hard
   Bb/C                            F
It slams through the gate, it'll catch you off guard
Everyone said, "What a perfect love match
'Cause she is so smart, she's a hell of a catch"

Am                      Bb
I was drinking in love, gulping it down
                         C
Drifting for months on a billowing cloud
But after awhile I stopped to rebel
I'm back in the past and I'm raising up hell

      Bb                                             F
But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

We'd been living together for over a year
The harmony's perfect, it rang loud and clear
But then very slowly, my nerves start to fray
The little things big, that's what they say

I acted impatient, I acted unkind
I took her for granted, I played with her mind
She didn't deserve it but it was too late
I walked out the door and left her to her fate

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

C/F Bb/F Am F (x2)
Am C F

Now I'm down in a slump and I'm eating alone
I ruined the day with some friends on the phone
I never go out, I'm becoming a grouch
I just watch the TV and I drink on the couch

But if love comes again, I'll be really surprised
I'll grab it real fast, keep it right in my sights

'Cause I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life
Well I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

C/F Bb/F Am F (fade out)
