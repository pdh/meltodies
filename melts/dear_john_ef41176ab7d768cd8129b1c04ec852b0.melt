Well when I woke up this mornin', there was a note upon my door
Said, "Don't make me no coffee, babe, I won't be back no more"
And that's all she wrote
 Bb   F       C7               F
(Dear John) I sent your saddle home

     F
Now, Jonah got along in the belly of the whale, Daniel in the lion's den
But I know a guy who didn't try to get along and he won't get a chance again
And that's all she wrote
 Bb   F        C7                  F
(Dear John!) I fetched your saddle home

(Pedal steel solo - verse pattern)

     F
Now she didn't bother no address, she didn't say goodbye
All she said was, "If you get blue, just hang your little head and cry"
And that's all she wrote
 Bb   F        C7               F
(Dear John!) I sent your saddle home

     F
Now, my gal's short and stubby, she's strong as she can be
But if that little ol' gal of mine ever gets a hold of me
That's all she wrote
 Bb   F        C7               F
(Dear John!) I sent your saddle home

(Fiddle solo - verse pattern)

(Repeat verse 2)
    F
Now I went down to the bank this mornin', the cashier said with a grin,
"I feel so sorry for you, Hank, but your wife has done been in."
And that's all she wrote
 Bb   F           C7               F
(Dear John!) I've sent your saddle home
