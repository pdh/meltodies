E                            E
Last night I came home and I knocked at my door
   E                  E              B7
I called for my love as oft I had before
    E                           E
I called once again but no answer there came
    E                         B7              E
No sweet lips to greet me, no voice called my name

[chorus]
  E                        E               A                      E
I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord I couldn't believe it was true
   E                           E 
My eyes filled with tears and I must have aged ten years
  E            B7          E
I couldn't believe it was true

I let myself in and I walked to our bed
I found a note there and a message I read
The truth like a bolt from the blue in the dawn
My sweetheart had left me, my darling was gone

(chorus)

The shock was so great I am quivering yet
I'll try to forgive her but I cannot forget
My heartbreaking loss is another mans gain
Her happiness always I hope will remain

(chorus)
