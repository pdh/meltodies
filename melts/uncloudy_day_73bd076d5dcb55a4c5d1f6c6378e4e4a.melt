When performed in the Movie "Broken Bridges" Willie plays it 5 half steps up, so 
transpose it (easiest) or put a capo on 5th fret to play along with that version. 
This just suits my voice better.
I can't remember if they play all verses listed below in the movie and they do 
have some solos here and there, but they follow the same pattern. Oh, and I made 
up my own ending... =)

Please rate/comment/correct.
