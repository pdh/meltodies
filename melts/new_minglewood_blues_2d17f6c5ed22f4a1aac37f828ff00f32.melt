New Minglewood Blues

E
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
       B
Oh, my number one occupation
                             E
Is stealing women from their men

            A
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas,
G                            E
Busted jail and I'm gone for good.
            A
Said, I'm a wanted man in Texas,
G                            E
Busted jail and I'm gone for good.
          B
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me,
                                  E
But his little girl sure wish she could.

Well now the doctor call me crazy,
Some says I am, some says I ain't,
Well now the doctor call me crazy,
Some says I am, some says I ain't,
Preacher man call me sinner
But his little girl calls me saint.

Well a couple shots of whiskey
Women `round here start looking good,
I said a couple shots of whiskey
Women `round here start looking good,
A couple more shots of whiskey,
I'm going down to Minglewood.

I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
Yes and my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

And I'll do it, do it again
I said my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
