TENNESSEE JED - GRATEFUL DEAD

Co7: x3x242     Dm7: x00211     C7: 3x2310

C G C G C
C                                  G C
Cold iron shackles, ball and chain.
Drink all day and rock all night.
I run into Charlie Fog.
F                            G       C     G C
Listen to the whistle of the evenin' train.
The law come to get you if you don't walk right.
Blacked my eye and he kicked my dog.
C           Co7      Dm7         C7
You know you bound to wind up dead
Got a letter this mornin', baby and all it read:
My doggie turned to me and he said.
C      F                     G      C   G C
if you don't head back to Tennessee Jed.
"You better head back to Tennessee Jed."
"Let's head back to Tennesse Jed."

C                              G C
Rich man step on my poor head.
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine.
I woke up feelin' mean.
F                             G         C     G C
When you get back, you better butter my bread.
Honey, come quick with the iodine.
I went down to play the slot machine.
         Co7    Dm7          C7
Well you know it's like I said:
Catch a few winks, baby, under the bed.
The wheels turned around and the letters read,
C   F                    G        C
you better head back to Tennessee Jed.
Then you head back to Tennessee Jed.
"You better head back to Tennessee Jed."

Bb F G C
F                           C                  G       F
Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be.
C              G     F
Baby won't you carry me
C      G      F    G C
back to Tennessee.
