Intro: G     G     G     G


Verse:
Am                                                                               G
 You say you love me And you're thinkin' of me, But you know you could be wrong.
Am                                                                                G
 You say you told me That you wanna hold me, But you know you're not that strong.
Bm                                Bm Bbm Am
I just can't do what I done before,        I just can't beg you anymore.
           G
I'm gonna let you pass
    D
And I'll go last.


Chorus:
      G        Bm/F#     Am/E    G/D      C                D    
Then time will tell just who has fell And who's been left behind,
 (no chord)                   G
When you go your way and I go mine.


Verse:
Am                                                                                G
 You say you disturb me And you don't deserve me, But you know sometimes you lie.
Am                                                                                G
 You say you're shakin' And you're always achin', But you know how hard you try.
     Bm                           Bm Bbm Am
Sometimes it gets so hard to care,        It can't be this way ev'ry-where.
              G
And I'm gonna let you pass,
         D
Yes, and I'll go last.


Chorus:
      G        Bm/F#     Am/E    G/D      C                D    
Then time will tell just who has fell And who's been left behind,
 (no chord)                   G
When you go your way and I go mine.


Bridge:
Em                                         D
 The judge, he holds a grudge, He's gonna call on you.
        Em                                                     D
But he's badly built And he walks on stilts, Watch out he don't fall on you.

Verse:
Am                                                                           G
 You say you're sorry For tellin' stories That you know I believe are true.
Am                                                                 G
 You say ya got some Other kinda lover And yes, I believe you do.
     Bm                           Bm Bbm Am
You say my kisses are not like his,       But this time I'm gonna tell you why that is.
               G
I'm just gonna let you pass,
         D
Yes, and I'll go last.

Then time will tell just who has fell And who's been left behind,
 (no chord)                   G
When you go your way and I go mine.
