              A         F#m
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson 
A               F#m                 D           E
Jesus loves you more than you will know Wo, wo, wo
              A            F#m
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson 
A              F#m                 D
Heaven holds a place for those who pray 
          E               F#m
Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey


F#m     
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files 
     B                                         highE
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself 
                 A               D           B       F#m
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes 
                          E
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home 


 
              A         F#m
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson 
A               F#m                D            E
Jesus loves you more than you will know Wo, wo, wo

Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey


F#m                                              B
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes 
                                         highE
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes 
              A                D             B
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair 
F#m                        E
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids 


             A          F#m
Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson 
A               F#m                D            E
Jesus loves you more than you will know Wo, wo, wo
              A            F#m
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson 
A              F#m                 D
Heaven holds a place for those who pray 
          E               F#m
Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey 



        
F#m                                      B
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon 
                                 highE
Going to the candidates debate 
                 A
Laugh about it, shout about it 
D                  B
When you've got to choose 
F#m                           E
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose 


               A           F#m
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio 
  A                F#m            D             E
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you Woo, woo, woo 
                A         F#m
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson 
A               F#m           D
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away 
          E               F#m
Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey
