Everything that I can have

It's gonna be alright

C
I gotta move
You got yours on your side
Hey now babe, I guess I'm falling in love

I got fever in my pocket
Down to my shoes
Oh babe, I guess I'm falling in love

You'd better move it on sweet babe
Hey on down to your shoes
Things they're right, mama
You know it'll work out fine
Hey you gotta lose

SOLO (play verse &amp; chorus chords under soloing)

I've got ankles in my breasts
I find it's hard to lose

Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love

Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love
F        G                    C
Oh babe, guess I'm falling in love
