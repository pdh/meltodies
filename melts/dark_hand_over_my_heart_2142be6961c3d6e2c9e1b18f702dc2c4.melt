Dark Hand Over My Heart 
 
G     Bm       Em    F 
Becky loved me and I let her
G      Bm         Em        F
Wish I could have loved her better
G             Em               D#                   Bb          C 
On the day we pulled apart she primed a time-bomb in my heart
G   Bm        Em     F
Now there's a shadow hiding
G   Bm        Em       F
Now there's a horseman riding
G            Em             D#                 Bb           
Lover of all broken things, standing waiting in the wings

F         G#           F      G# 
Sometimes I wonder why I love and let it die
F           G#                   G          F
Can't give, can't live just to hold back, hold back

Chorus:
          D#   Dm              D#   Dm
There's a dark hand, there's a dark hand
          D#   Dm           G#
There's a dark hand over my heart (repeat)

 
You call me fraud and faker
You call me user, taker
You say I throw you scraps, prove my strength by holding back
But I shine my honour brightly
Swear my allegiance nightly
But through my hands it slips, the same old demons paint their lips

Sometimes I wonder why... 

Chorus
