Intro: Am  Em  G   Am

    Am            Em         G                 Am
 The wagons in the valley had pulled up for the night
		     Em              G                     Am
 Seth said go get the plow out Merle, this place looks just right
		     Em          G                  Am
 By then they were surrounded, by dawn they all were dead
		      Em       G           Am
 I heard this from the Trans-Am up the road ahead
     D                C/G        D                   C/G
 That cowboy just kept talking, I thought I heard him say
   D                C/G        D                    Am
 He used to ride the Santa Fe before the tracks were laid


A nasty wind was blowing through the gates of Eden Park
on was swinging and one was hanging
and the streets all were dark
it crawled along the boulevard with two wheels on the grass
that old Trans Am was dying hard but it still had lots of gas
the golden gate was open wide, the sun came shining through
where once the angles stood and cried everything was new
Trans Am

Global manufacuting, hands across the sea
the hotel filled with dealers, evrything was free
before the competition, ahead of all the rest
the product was presented, it clearly was the best
th epower link was ruptured, the hotel shook and rolled
the old Trans Am just bounced around and took another road
Trans Am

An old freind showed up at the door
The mile posts flying by
he say come on, I said what for
he said I'll show you why
I got a call from north of here
They said some girls broke down
there's good money in it for you and me
if we can get her back to town
she's somewhere north of Barstow
lost on 66
an old Trans Am by the side of the road
the needs a headlight fixed
Trans Am
