I was not able to find a decent chart for the full weather report suite so I went ahead and arranged
this.  I arranged the prelude from scratch and edited jdarks.com for part 1and rukind.com for Let It 
Grow.

(Into Weather Report Suite Part I) (source: jdarks.com)

E                         C#m 
Winter rain, now tell me why, 
                       D 
Summers fade, and roses die. The answer 
C#m7                   F#m 
came, the wind and rain. 

| A - E - | A - E - | 

         E                     C#m 
Golden hills, now veiled in grey, 
                           D 
Summer leaves have blown away. Now what 
C#m7                      F#m 
remains? The wind and rain. 

| A - E - | A - E - | 

      E7              C# 
And like a desert spring, 
   A                   G 
My lover comes and spreads her wings. 
D                G 
Knowing, like a song that's born to soar the sky, 
 D                 G 
Flowing, flowing 'til the waters all are dry, 
D             C 
Growing, the loving in her eyes.

        E                    C#m 
Circle songs and sands of time, 
C#m                   D
Seasons will end in tumbled rhyme,   
             C#m7              F#m 
And little change, the wind and rain. 

| A - E - | A - E - |

My lover comes and spreads her wings. 
D                 G 
Knowing, like a song that's born to soar the sky, 
D                  G 
Flowing, flowing 'til the rivers all are dry, 
D               C 
Growing, the loving in her eyes.

B                           E
Winter gray and falling rain,
B                      E
We'll see summer come again,
B                           E
Darkness falls and seasons change,
(gonna happen every time)
B                              E
Same old friends the wind and rain,
(we'll see summer by and by)
B                        E
Winter gray and falling rain,
(summers roses die)
B                      E
We'll see summer come again,
E
Like a song that's born to soar the sky.

Intro:  Am7   

Am                                                Bdim7
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Am                                                   Bdim7
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning’s door
Am           C
See the sun, sparkle in the reeds
Am           C                 Bm  D
Silver beads, pass to the sea

D                                                           A7
She comes from a town where they call her the wood cutter’s daughter
                                                            D
She’s brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
                                                 Bm
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her
Am                        C               Em/F#
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

       Em/F#
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   x   X   |   |   X
|---|---|---|---|---|

|---|---|---|---|---|

Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed fields
Season’s round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning
To the spring, black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

Em/F#         B             G            Em/F#
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name
   C                 G      Bm7
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Em/F# B             G                 Em/F#
Water bright as the sky from which it came
        D                                  A
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
   C                   G                Em/F#
We will not speak, but stand inside the rain
    C      G      D       Em      Am          C     Em/F#
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am, I am, I am, I am"

Jam on verse pattern

So it goes, we make what we made since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down, as we rise and fall

Fm  -   E    -   D

Jam on Am7

Jam on Em7
