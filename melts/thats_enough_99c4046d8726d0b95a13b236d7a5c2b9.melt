E
Well, now I heard that you been talking about me,  
B7              E
Really, I don't mind
E  
I know you try to block my progress,  
F#7          B7
A lot of the time. 
 
E
Well the mean things you said, don't make me feel bad 
        A 
Cause I can't miss a friend, that I never had,
E                     B7 
(I've got)  I've got Jesus, and that's enough,
A              E  
(that's enough) that's enough. 
 
A
When I'm sick, (he's there), in trouble, (he's there) 
A                                         E
When I call him he will answer my prayer (Answer my prayer) 

When I'm burdened, (he's there), with a load, (he's there), 
  F#7                              B7
That's when Jesus is a comforter to my soul 
 
 
E 
Well, you may scorn me, turn your back on me, 
A
God's got his arms wrapped all around me 
E                   B7                      E
(I've got) I've got Jesus, and that's enough,  
A               E
(that's enough) that's enough.

G
You know there's been a lot of times when I didn't have a dime, 
C                             G   
I didn't cry to nobody but my Lord.
G 
He heard my plea, and came to see about me,  
F#7                    D7  
cause He's one thing I can afford 
 
 G
So if you push me down, He'll pick me up 
C                                         G
And He'll stick by me when the going gets tough,
                    D7 
(I've got) I've got Jesus, and that's enough,  
C               G
(that's enough) that's enough. 
 
G                                                     
Well He's the great emancipator and my heart regulator,
C          G   
(Jesus is),  yes he is 
G
He'll make my way brighter and my burden lighter,  
A7             D7
(yes He will), Jesus will 
 
G
Well, you may scorn me, turn your back on me, 
C
God's got his arms wrapped all around me 
G                              D7                        G
And He fights down the devil 'till he makes him give up, and that's enough, 
C               G   
(that's enough) that's enough.
