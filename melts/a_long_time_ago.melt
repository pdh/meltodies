******************* A LONG TIME AGO *******************

performed by Waylon Jennings.


Capo on the 2nd fret.

Verse 1:
         B
	I don't look the way the average cowboy singer looks
             E
	I'll admit i've taken things i never should of took
                 F#
	You can read a different story in a lot of different books
            E
	But even then you won't really know
                F#               B
	How it was a long time ago


Verse 2:
         B
	Women have been my trouble since i found out they weren't men
             E
	In spite of that i stopped and took a wife now and then
	      F#
	They built their fences high but they couldn't hold me in
               E
	I was born with a fire down below
               F#                          B
	And i learned to fly a long time ago


Verse 3:
         B
	Don't ask me about the years i spent out in the rain
           E
	About the ones i spent in love or the ones i spent insane
              F#
	Don't ask me who i gave my seat to on that plane
            E
	I think you already know
           F#                         B
	I told you that a long time ago


Verse 4:(a tone higher)
         C#
	Me and ol' Willie,lordy we've been sold and bought
            F#
	I guess you all heard about some kind of system that we fought
            G#
	We ain't the only outlaws just the only ones they caught
               F#
	They tried to run us off but Willie's slow
            G#                       C#
	I quit running a long time ago
