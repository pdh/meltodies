Song: Whiskey River Tab

[G] Whiskey River take my [C] mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture [G] me
Whiskey River don't run [D7] dry
You're all I've got, take care of [G] me.

[G] I'm drowning in a whiskey [C] river
[G] bathing my mem'ried mind
   In the [A7] wetness of its [D7] soul
[G] Feeling the amber current
   [G7] flowin' from my [C] mind
And [D] leaving a heart you left so [G] cold.
