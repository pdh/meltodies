Bob Dylan - Self portrait - Belle Isle

this is my first tab and if you ask me it sounds 100% right


     C                         F
One evenin', for pleasure, I rambled to view
     C          G      C
The fair fields all alone,
                      F
Down by the banks of Loch Erin,
       G                         C
Where beauty and pleasure were known.
   Am                       Em
I spied a fair maid at her labors,
       Am                      G7
Which caused me to stay for a while,
       C                          Em
And I thought of this goddess of beauty,
  F                            C
Bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle.

             Am            Em
I humbled my self to her beauty.
       F                    C
"fair maiden where do you belong?
              Am          Em
Are you from heaven descended,
   F                      G7
A biding in Cupid's fair throne?"
       Am                     Em
"young man i will tell you a secret.
     Am                      Em
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
        C                         Am
And to part from my vows and my promise,
        F                       Fm
That's more then my heart can endure."
        C                      Am
"there fore, I remain at my service,
         Em                          G7
And go through all my hard ship and toil,
     C            Em             Am
And wait for the lad that has left me
       F           G              C
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
       Em                       G
        C         Am           Em
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter.
      F                      C
'Tis true I come here in disguise.
         Am                Em        Am
I came to fulfill our last promise,
     Dm                  G7
And hope to give you a surprise."
       Am                          G
"I've known you're a maid I love dearly
            Am         Em             G7
And you've been in my heart all the while.
    C           Em        Am
For me there is no other damsel
          F              G               C
Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle."
   Am                   Em
   F                    Fm
   C                    Am
   F        G           C
