Is it (C) me you’re talking (G) to or just a (Am) woman
Can I (C) believe the tender (G) way you hold me (Am) tight
When I (C) give him all I (G) can
Will I (Am) ever see you (F) again
Is it (C) me or just a (G) woman you need (C) tonight

Is it (C) you behind that (G) sweet talk or is it (Am) whiskey
Are you (C)  in it for the (G) falling off the (Am) high
Am I (C) the one you’re looking (G) for
Or am (Am) I just one (F) more
Is it (C) me or just a (G) woman you need (C) tonight

Do you want (C) my heart (G) my hands my (C) love
Or am I (C) just a woman’s (G) touch

Is it (C) me you’re reaching (G) for or just a (Am) woman
Once you’d (C) love me with the (G)  simply say good(Am)bye
Or will I (C) wake up to be (G) yours
Will I (Am) wish I could be (F) sure
Is it (C) me or just a (G) woman you need (C) tonight
Is it (C) me or just a (G) woman you need (C) tonight
