I'd noticed this had been posted a few times before, but I'd never found it 
totally correct, nor had I found anyone who'd tabbed the whole thing. So
here goes

E               A       B
I'm living with war everyday
E               A         B          A
I'm living with war in my heart every day
E               A         B
I'm living with war right now

E                        A
And when the dawn breaks I see my fellow man
E                         B              A
And on the flat-screen we kill and we're killed again
E                         A
And when the night falls, I pray for peace
E      B        A
Try to remember peace

E
I join the multitudes
A
I raise my hand in peace
E                  B           A
I never bow to the laws of the thought police
E
I take a holy vow
A
To never kill again
E        B    A
To never kill again

E               A         B
I'm living with war in my heart
E               A         B           A
I'm living with war in my heart in my mind
E               A         B
I'm living with war right now

E                       
Don't take no tidal wave
A
Don't take no mass grave
E       
Don't take no smokin' gun
B               A                
To show how the west was won
E                           A
But when the curtain falls, I pray for peace
E      B        A
Try to remember peace

E         
In the crowded streets
A
In the big hotels
E                      B            A  
In the mosques and the doors of the old museum
E
I take a holy vow
A
To never kill again
E      B        A      
Try to remember peace

E A E

A
The rocket's red glare
                  E  
Bombs bursting in air
A
Give proof through the night,
                       E
That our flag is still there

E               A   B
I'm living with war everyday
E               A         B           A 
I'm living with war in my heart every day
E               A         B   
I'm living with war right now 

Finish on E
