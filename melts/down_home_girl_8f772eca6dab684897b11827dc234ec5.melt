G7
Lord I swear the perfume you wear 
Was made out of turnip greens 
And every time I kiss you girl 
It tastes like pork and beans
C7
Even though you're wearin' them 
Citified high heels 
G7
I can tell by your giant steps 
You been walkin' through the cotton fields
D7         C7      G7 
Oh, you're so down home girl 
G7
Every time you monkey child 
You take my breath away 
And every time you move like that 
I gotta get down and pray 
C7
Don't you know that dress of yours 
Was made out of fiberglass 
G7
And every time you move like that 
I gotta go to Sunday mass 
D7         C7      G7
Oh, you're so down home girl 
 
G7
I'm gonna take you to the muddy river 
And push you in 
Just to watch the water roll on 
Down your velvet skin 
C7
I'm gonna take you back to New Orleans 
Down in Dixieland 
G7
I'm gonna watch you do the second line 
With an umbrella in your hand
D7         C7      G7 
Oh, you're so down home girl 
G7
I'm with ya baby 
You're so down home 
Ow! Yeah, too much 
Outta sight 
You're so down home girl
