Willie Nelson (Written By Lefty Frizzel) - Look What Thoughts Will Do

Chorus:

G
Once I thought I loved just you
 
And I thought you loved me too
 D7
But just look what thoughts will do
 G
For today you say we're through
 

Now another wears the crown
 
And you think that you have found
 D7
Just what makes your world go round
 G
Watch those thoughts they'll get you down
 

If within your future years
 
Your new love should bring you tears
 D7
Then you'll think of me I'm sure
 G
But those thoughts won't help you de(ar

(Repeat 1st Verse)
