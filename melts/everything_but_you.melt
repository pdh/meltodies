D.                         A7.                D
I've got a new car and it drives just like a dream
                       A7.           D.  D7
I've got money and can buy most anything      
         G.                D
I've got places to go and things to do 
         A7.                        D. 
I've got everything everything but you

D.                                A7.                 D
I've got a date book that's just bulging you at the seams
                        A7.           D.    D7
I've got the numbers of all the local Queens  
          G.                      D.           
they give me memories that last a day or two
         A7.                        D  D7
I've got everything everything but you    
3.
          G.                           D
But this new car I Drive don't mean any thing
       A7.                         D.     D7
which reminds me there's a payment overdue
           G.                          D
And they say that I'm a man who's got everything
            A7.                       D
yeah of got everything everything but you
