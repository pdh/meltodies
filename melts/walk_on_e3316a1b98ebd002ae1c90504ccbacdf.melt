WALK ON

Amaj7  D  Amaj7  D

   A       D            A     D
I hear som people been talkin me down,

A       D         A    D
bring up my name, pass it 'round.

A         D        A    D
They don't mention happy times;

A      D            A       D
they do their thing, I'll do mine.


A  C#m              F#
   Oo baby, that's hard to change;

A  C#m                      F#
   I can't tell them how to feel.

A  C#m             F#
   Some get stoned, some get strange,

E                      D
but sooner or later it all gets real.

       Amaj7  D      Amaj7
Walk on,      walk on,

D      Amaj7  D      Amaj7
walk on,      walk on.


I remember the good old days,
stayed up all night gettin' crazed.
Then the money was not so good,
but we still did the best we could.

   Oo baby, that's hard to change;
   I can't tell them how to feel.
   Some get stoned, some get strange,
but sooner or later it all gets real.
Walk on,      walk on,
walk on,      walk on.
