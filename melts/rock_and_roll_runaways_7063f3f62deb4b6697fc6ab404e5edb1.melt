Lyrics

Jenny said when she was just five years old
There was nothing happening at all
Every time she puts on a radio
There was a nothin’ goin’ down at all, not at all
Then one fine mornin’ she puts on a new york station
You know, she couldn’t believe what she heard at all
She started dancin’ to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by rock ’n’ roll
Despite all the amputations you know you could just go out
And dance to a rock ’n’ roll station

It was alright
It was alright
Hey baby you know it was alright

Jenny said when she was just by five years old
You know y parents gonna be the death of us all
Two tv sets and two cadillac cars -
Well you know it ain’t gonna help me at all
Then one fine mornin’ she turnss on a new york station
She doesn’t believe what she hears at all
Ooh, she started dancin’ to that fine fine music
You know her life is saved by rock ’n’ roll,
Despite all the computations
You could just dance to a rock ’n’ roll station

And baby it was alright
And it was alright
Hey it was alright
Hey here she comes now!

It was alright
