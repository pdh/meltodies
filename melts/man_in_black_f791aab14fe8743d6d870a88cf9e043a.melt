Man in black – Johnny Cash

I’ve based this tab on one I found on Ultimate Guitar, but that sounded a little bit too 
Normally, it is played with a capo on the second fret (in A), but I've always played it 
this (in G). This is the way I play it:

Chords:
    eadgbe
G:  320003
C:  x32010
Am: x02210
D7: xx021

         G            C               G
Well you wonder why I always dress in black
				  C            Am
Why you never see bright colors on my back
    C              G               C               G
And why does my appearance seem to have that sombe tone
               Am                                D7
Well there’s a reason for the things that I have on

  G                      C                   G
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten-down
                       C              Am
Living on the hopeless hungry side of town
  C               G                C                 G
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
             Am                          D7
But is still in there as a victim of the time

  G                  C                  G
I wear the black for those who’ve never read
                   C                Am
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
 C                G                 C             G
About the road to hapinnes, through love and charity
              Am                                     D7
Why you would think he’s talking straight to you and me

           G            C              G
Well we’re doing mighty fine, I do suppose
                            C              Am
In  our streak-of-lightning-cars and fancy clothes
    C                G            C                 G
But just so we’re reminded of the ones who are held back
   Am                               D7
Up front there ought to be a man in black

  G               C               G
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
                            C                   Am
For the reckless ones whose bad trips left them cold
  C                 G                C                     G
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
     Am                                D7
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men

      G               C                  G
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
                   C                 Am
Believing that the Lord was on their side
  C             G             C                 G
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
   Am                               D7
Believing that we all were on their side

               G                 C               G
Well, there’re things that never will be right I know
				  C              Am
And things need changing everywhere you go
     C                G              C                 G
But ‘till we start to make a move to make a few things right
       Am                          D7
You’ll never see me wear a suit of white

         G              C            G
And I’d love to wear a rainbow everyday
                        C              Am
And tell the world that everything’s okay
          C           G             C              G
But I’ll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
                  Am       D7             G
‘till things are brighter, I’m the man in black
