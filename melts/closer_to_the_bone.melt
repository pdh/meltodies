It's most likely not what he actually plays, but these chords sound about right to me.

Listen to the song to figure out the strumming pattern and how to alternate 
between A and Asus2 (which is simply the A with your third finger lifted.)

Intro: A Asus2 A Asus2

First Verse:

                   A Asus2 A Asus2
Ain't it kinda funny

                  A       Asus2 A Asus2
Ain't it just the way though

                    E
Ain't 'cha gettin' better

                 A Asus2 A Asus2
Runnin' out of time

               A Asus2 A Asus2
Making pretty music

                  A Asus2 A Asus2
Closer to your feelings

                 E
Working on the reason

                A Asus2 A Asus2
Running on the rhyme


Chorus:

                  D
Heading for the highway

                A Asus2 A Asus2
Rolling like a river

                 E
Soaring like an eagle

                 A Asus2 A Asus2
Skippin' like a stone
                
                  D
Comin' from the heartbeat

                  A Asus2 A Asus2
Nothin' but the truth now

                E
Everything is sweeter

             A Asus2 A Asus2
Closer to the bone


Second Verse:

Ain't afraid of moonlight 
Ain't afraid of freedom 
Love will make you crazy 
But your soul will keep you sane 

Singing to the starlight 
Over the horizon 
Open to the pleasure 
Equal to the pain


Chorus:
Heading for the highway
Rolling like a river 
Soaring like an eagle 
Skippin' like a stone 
Comin' from the heartbeat 
Nothin' but the truth now 
Everything is sweeter 
Closer to the bone
