I noticed the other tab was a little off. this is the correct version              
 
                 Am
Where the road is dark
                C
And the seed is sewed
                 Am
Where the gun is cocked
                C
As the bullet's cold
                   Am        G
Where the miles are marked
                      Am       G
In the blood and the gold
        F                G         Am
And ill meet you further on up the road
                   Am
Got on my dead man suit
                     C
And my smilin' skull ring
                   Am
My lucky graveyard boots
              C
And a song to sing
                Am      G
I got a song to sing
                          Am       G
That keeps me out of the cold
        F                G          Am 
And ill meet you further on up the road

                  C
Further on up the road
                  Am
Further on up the road
                 C
Where the way is dark
                 E
And the night is cold
           Am     G
One sunny mornin'
             Am     G
We'll rise i know
        F                G         Am 
And ill meet you further on up the road

                        Am
Now ive been out in the desert
              C
Just doin' my time
                      Am
Searchin' through the dust
              C
Lookin' for a sign
                      G
If there's a light up ahead
                    Am     G
Well brother i dont know
        F              G             Am 
But ive got this fever burnin' in my soul

                  C
Further on up the road
                  Am
Further on up the road
                  C
Further on up the road
                  E
Further on up the road
          Am     G
One sunny mornin'
             Am     G
We'll rise i know
        F                G         Am     
And ill meet you further on up the road
