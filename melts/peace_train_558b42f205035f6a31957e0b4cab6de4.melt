Peace Train chords
Cat Stevens *

    C    G    C
Now I've been happy lately, 
F         C        F
thinking about the good things to come
    G   Am 
And I believe it could be, 
F         G    F
something good has begun

   C    G    C
Oh I've been smiling lately, 
F         C        F
dreaming about the world as one
    G   Am
And I believe it could be, 
F    G        F
some day it's going to come

      C   G      C
Cause out on the edge of darkness, 
F     C       F
there rides a peace train
         G     Am
Oh peace train take this country, 
F    G       F
come take me home again

    C    G    C
Now I've been happy lately, 
F         C        F
thinking about the good things to come
    G   Am 
And I believe it could be, 
F         G    F
something good has begun

   C     G     C        G  C
Oh peace train sounding louder
F     C      F
Glide on the peace train
F    G  Am
Come on now 
F    G      F
come on the peace train

C     G     C    G  C  
peace train holy roller
F        C             F
Everyone jump upon the peace train
F   G   Am
oooooooooo
F       G   F
Come on now peace train

Get your bags together, 
go bring your good friends too
Cause it's getting nearer, 
it soon will be with you

Now come and join the living, 
it's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer, 
soon it will all be true

Now I've been crying lately, 
thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating, 
why can't we live in bliss

Cause out on the edge of darkness, 
there rides a peace train
Oh peace train take this country, 
come take me home again
