    Childhood living   is easy to do

    the things you wanted        I bought them for you

    Graceless lady     you know who I am

    I watched you suffer   a dull aching pain

    now you decided     to show me the same
  Bm               G      Bm      G
    no sweet thing exits    or of stage lines
  Am                  C     D   G                Dsus2  C
    could make me feel better     or treat you unkind

    Wild Horses     couldn't drag me away

    wild wild horses     couldn't drag me away

  Am          C       D  G                       D     C
    I have my freedom      but I don't have much time
  Bm               G      Bm              G
    Faith has been broken   tears must be cried

    Lets do some living     after we died

    wild wild horses     we'll ride them some day
  Am     C      D  G         F        C
