Verse 1:
         D
	Well i woke up this morning it was drizzling rain

	Around the curve called a passenger train

	I heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan

	Jimmy he's dead it's been a long time gone
                          G
	Been a long time gone
                     D
	A long time gone


Verse 2:
         D
	If you want to get to heaven got to d-i-e

	You got to put on your coat and t-i-e

	Want to get the rabbit out of the l-o-g

	Gotta make A commotion like A D-o-G
                   G
	Like A D-o-G
                   D
	Like A D-o-G


Verse 3:
         D
	I gotta good woman what's the matter with me

	What makes me want to love every woman i see

	I was traveling when i met her now i'm traveling again

	And every women she sees looks like a place i came in
                                  G
	Looks like a place i came in
                     D
	Place i came in

	I don't have to work
