E
Oh help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
E                                       A    A7
There's a pain where there once was a heart
E
It's sleepin, it's a beatin'
           D             A            E
Can't ya please tear it out, and preserve it
        B            E
Right there in that jar?


E
Oh help me, please mama, I'm sick'ning
E                                  A    A7
It's today that's the day of the plunge
E
Oh the gal I'm to marry
D                A
Is a bow-legged sow
E                      B            E
I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge

E
"Don't ya worry, get dressed," cried my mother
E                                A   A7
As she plied me with bourbon so sour
E
Pull your socks up, put your suit on
           D         A
Comb your long hair down,
E                B          E
For you will be wed in the hour

E
So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
E                                      A    A7
There's a pain where there once was a heart
E
I'm sleepin, it's a beatin'
           D             A         E
Can't ya please take it out, and preserve it
       B             E
Right there in that jar?

Oh help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
E                                      A    A7
There's a pain where there once was a heart
      E
It's sleepin, it's a beatin'
           D             A         E
Can't ya please tear it out, and preserve it
       B             E
Right there in that jar?

E
I was tremblin', as I put on my jacket
E                             A    A7
It had creases as sharp as a knife
            E
I put the ring in my pocket
      D          A
But there was a note
         E              B       E
And my heart it jumped into my mouth

E
It read, "Darlin', I'm sorry to hurt you.
E                                       A    A7
But I have no courage to speak to your face.
E                              D           A
But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou
           E       B      E
There will be no wedding today."

E
So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
E                                 A   A7
You can put back my heart in its hole
E                    D        A
Oh mama, I'm cryin' Tears of relief
E                    B     E
And my pulse is now under control
