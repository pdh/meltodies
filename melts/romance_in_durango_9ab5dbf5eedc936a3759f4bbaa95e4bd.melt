D                                   A
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun 
                       G   D
Dust on my face and my cape,
                        A
Me and Magdalena on the run 
                              G   D
I think this time we shall escape.
 

Sold my guitar to the baker's son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
But I can get another one
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
 

    A
    No llores, mi querida

    Dios nos vigila
                                     G  D
    Soon the horse will take us to Durango. 
      A
    Agarrame, mi vida
    Soon the desert will be gone
                                    G  D
    Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
