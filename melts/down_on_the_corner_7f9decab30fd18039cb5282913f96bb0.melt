Down On The Corner chords
Creedence Clearwater Revival

C                    G                 C
Early in the evening just about supper time,
                               G             C
Over by the courthouse they re starting to unwind.
F                       C
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up.
                              G               C
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp.

F           C       G          C
Down on the corner, out in the street,
              F            C
Willy and the poorboys are playin;
        G                C
Bring a nickel; tap your feet.

C                              G                  C
Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile,
                                G            C
Blinky, thumps the gut bass and solos for a while.
F                             C
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo.
                            G          C
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo.

F           C       G          C
Down on the corner, out in the street,
              F            C
Willy and the poorboys are playin;
        G                C
Bring a nickel; tap your feet.

F           C       G          C
Down on the corner, out in the street,
              F            C
Willy and the poorboys are playin;
        G                C
Bring a nickel; tap your feet.

C                      G              C
You don t need a penny just to hang around,
                                      G              C
But if you ve got a nickel, won t you lay your money down? 
F                  C
Over on the corner there s a happy noise.
                               G               C
People come from all around to watch the magic boy.

F           C       G          C
Down on the corner, out in the street,
              F            C
Willy and the poorboys are playin;
        G                C
Bring a nickel; tap your feet.  3x
