This is a rather basic version of the song, I figured it out myself after hearing the song.
The original lyrics are a Shel Silverstein poem, and the song is from a tribute album that was made shortly
following Shels death.
*capo on second fret*

                   F    E/F    F
I'll let her go cheap,
                      G
Tho' she's pretty to look at, 
                     C
She don't earn her keep.
                      C
She can roar like the west wind, 
        C
She can weep. 
         F     E/F      F
She can wail.
                        G                   G7
But the tunes that she plays ain't sellin' today,

                    F
She's laid here beside me
                 C
On cold winter nights.
                  G7
She's got me in trouble
                   G7
She's won me some fights,
 N.C
We both came out all right! 

                  C
She knows every sad song
                 F      E/F    F
That Hank ever wrote.
                     G
Just touch her once gently, 
                      C
And she'll take you on home.
                     C
She'll tell you sad stories 
                       F     E/F       F
'Bout junk yards and jails
                  G
And a fool with a song, 
                        G7
And a love that's gone wrong.

                        F
She's rode 'cross this country
                         C
On freight trains and trucks
                       G7
Hung 'round pawn shop windows
                             G7
When we've been down on our luck
 N.C
And we've been down on our luck!

                    C
So please treat her kindly.
                    F      E/F     F
Keep her out of the rain.
                   G
It's funny you're askin'...
                    C
I never gave her a name.
                        C
If you think she looks weary, 
                         F      E/F    F
You've been readin' our mail.
                   G
If you've got the dough, 
             G7
Take her and go,

                     F
She's won me some ladies
                       C
With her sweet lovin' songs
                           G7
And she stayed right here with me 
                      G7
When the ladies were gone.
 N.C
And the ladies are gone!

                     C
But hard times and troubles 
                  F     E/F    F
Been doggin' our tale.

If you've got the dough,

Buddy, take her and go,
