this song is my first tab...but i can play it well..i think...
it has a weird strum to it. its a basic strum down, up, down, and up...
but when you go down the second time you have to mute the strings with your
palm...try practice the strum before you play or just strum normally...enjoy and please rate
...this might br the original way to play it, but don't know

I don't know what this chord is called lol..but you need it
