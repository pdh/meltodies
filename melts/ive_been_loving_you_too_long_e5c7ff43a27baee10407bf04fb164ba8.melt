I think this is an Otis Redding song but here is my interpretation for you all
Yeah This is OTIS REDDING not MUDDY WATERS but here is the thing I wanted to contribute my first
request so there you have it everyone. But I can't believe people confuse a blues guitarist with soul singer.

OTIS REDDING: SOUL SINGER
MUDDY WATERS: BLUES GUITARIST for all of you who are not familiar please don't make
this mistake. 

           A        E           A          E
I've been loving you too long to stop now

 A      Dbm                    Db 
You are tired and you want to be free
D                                  F 
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
     A                    E 
Ohh, I've been loving you too long
A                        E./   E./  E./ 
I don't wanna stop now

A                    E
With you my life has been so wonderful
A                   E
I can't stop now
A                     Dbm    Db  
You are tired and your love is growing cold
D                                 F 
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
A                     E 
I've been loving you oh, too long
A                            F  
I don't want to stop now, ohh, ohh, ohh

A#                   F 
I've been loving you a little too long
A#                   F#
I don't wanna stop now, ohh, ohh, ohh
A#               F#
And don't make me stop now
A#       F#
Oh baby
I'm down on my knees
A#              F#
Please, don't make me stop now

A#            F#                                             (A# and F# till the end)
I love you, I love you, I love you with all my heart
And I can't stop now
Please, please, please don't make me stop now
Talkin' 'bout heart and soul
That I love you
I love you
