     YOU GOT TO MOVE
     The Rolling Stones, off Sticky Fingers, 1971 
     (submitted by david.mays@merrick.com)
     
                A
     You got to move, you got to move
                D                      A
     You got to move child, you got to move 
     A                       E
     Cause when the Lord get ready
                A
     You got to move.
     
     You may be white, you may be dark
     You may be rich child, you may be poor 
     But when the Lord get ready
     You got to move
     
     You see that woman, who walks the street 
     You see that police, upon his beat
     Gut when the Lord get ready
     You got to move.
