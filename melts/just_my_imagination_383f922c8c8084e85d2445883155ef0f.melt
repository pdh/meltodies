Each day through my window I watch up as she passes by / / / /
C                       F            C   F
I say to myself, You're such a lucky guy / / / /
C                   F              C          F
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
       C                     F            C            F
Out of all the fellas in the world, she belongs to you / / /

           C                   F       C                    F
But it was just my 'magination / / / / runnin' away with me / /
       C              F            C            F

(Soon) Soon we'll be married and raise a family (wo yeah)

A cozy little home out in the country, with two children, maybe three / / /
            C   F           C           F
I tell you, I------can visualize it all / / / /
     C                      F                    C         F
This couldn't be a dream, I tell you how real it all seems / / /

           C                   F          C                    F
But it was just my 'magination once again runnin' away with me / /
                 C              F            C
Tell you, it was just my 'magination runnin' away with me 1 / / / 2

Every night, on my knees, I pray
Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
           G7
Or I would surely die / / /
            C
Her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I feel a tender love so deep
But in reality, she doesn't even know me

(Repeat and fade):
C                   F          C                     F
Just my 'magination once again runnin' away with me, oh
                 C              F            C            F
Tell you, it was just my 'magination runnin' away with me / / / /
