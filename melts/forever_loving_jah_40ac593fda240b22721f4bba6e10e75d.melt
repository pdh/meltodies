We'll be forever loving Jah

F#m                       Bm            C#m
Some they say see them walking up the street
               F#m                      Bm       C#m
They say we are going wrong to all the people we meet
              F#m                      Bm   C#m
But we won't worry, we won't shed no tears
       F#m                  Bm   C#m
We found a way to cast away the fears

We'll be forever loving Jah, there'll be no end

           F#m          Bm   C#m
So old man river don't dry for me
                   F#m              Bm   C#m
I have got a running stream of love you see
                  F#m           Bm   C#m
So no matter what stages, oh stages, stages
                  F#m                   Bm   C#m
Stages they put us thru we'll never be blue
                F#m        Bm   C#m
No matter what rages, oh rages, changes.
                  F#m                    Bm   C#m
Rages they put us thru, we'll never be blue

We'll be forever loving Jah
(Forever and ever and forever
Cause there is no end)

             F#m        Bm        C#m
Cause only a fool lean up on, lean upon
           F#m            Bm   C#m
His own misunderstanding
                  F#m              Bm           C#m
And what has been hidden from the wise and the prudent,
                      F#m                    
Been revealed to the babe and the suckling
          Bm                  C#m
In every thing, in every way I say

F#m                      Bm   C#m
We'll be forever loving Jah
(We'll be forever)
F#m                      Bm   C#m
We'll be forever loving Jah

                   F#m     Bm   C#m                   F#m                      
Cause just like a tree planted planted by the river of water
                             Bm      C#m                 F#m
That bringeth forth bringeth forth, fruits in due season
         Bm            C#m         F#m
Every thing in life got its purpose
         Bm              C#m
Find its reason in every season, forever Yeah!

F#m                      Bm   C#m
We'll be forever loving Jah
(We'll be forever)
F#m                      Bm   C#m
We'll be forever loving Jah
(On and on and on)
F#m                      Bm   C#m
We'll be forever loving Jah

(Fade out again....)
