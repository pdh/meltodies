Tabbed by: D!zZ~3

Tuning: Standard

Not quite sure what version the guy that did the other tab was listenin' to but this is 
I've always heard it. Note that all chords get two beats unless noted by an asterisk*, 
they get one beat.

And I'm doin' the lyrics by memory so bear with me.

Intro: E  A*  B*  E  E
       E  A*  B*  E  E

Verse 1:
E      A*    B*  E    E
Nobody feels any pain
E            A*      B*       E    E
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
    A         B
But everybody knows
     A              B
That baby's got new clothes
    A*  E* F#m* E*       A                B
But lately I've seen her ribbions and her bows
     C#m    B*   A*  B    B
Have fallen from her curls

Chorus 1:
    E     G#m* F#m*   A     A
She takes just like a woman yes she does
    E          G#m* F#m*   A     A
She makes love just like a woman yes she does
    E     G#m* F#m*   A    A
She aches just like a woman
           B                  B      E
Oh but she breaks just like a little girl

Lick: Just bar the 9th fret then the 11th then back

Verse 2:
      E    A*    B* E     E
Queen Mary she's my friend
      E            A*     B*  E    E
Yes I believe I'll go see her again
  A           B
Nobody has to guess
     A             B
That baby can't be blessed
      A*  E*      F#m* E*   A               
 B
'Till she finally sees that shes like all the rest
         C#m              B*    A*      B     B
With her fogs her emphitatmines and her pearls

Chorus 1
Lick

Bridge:
       G#            G#
It was rain from the first
          G#       G#
And I was dyin' of thirst
          E            E E E
'Till you came in here
         G#        G#
And your long time curse hurts
   G#      G#
But what's worse
        A           A
Is this pain in here
        B           B
I can't stay in here
B             B
Ain't it clear

Verse 3:
     E A*   B*    E  E
That I just can't fit
        E          A*       B*    E   E
Yes I believe it's time for us to quit
    A             B
But when we meet again
A             B
Introduced as friends
A*     E*    F#m*E* A             B
Please don't let on that you knew when
      C#m               A    B     B
I was hungry and it was your world

Chorus 2:
    E    G#m* F#m*   A     A
You take just like a woman yes you do
    E         G#m* F#m*   A     A
You make love just like a woman yes you do
       E    G#m* F#m*   A    A
Oh you fake just like a woman
           B                 B      E
Oh but you break just like a little girl

Lick

End on E
