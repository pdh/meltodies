CAPO #2

C
Everybody's looking for some way in,
    F                      C
I'm looking for some way out.

I've been wasting my time, standing in line,
   G                        C 
If this is what it's all about.


C
All I got is a job that I don't like,
       F                       C
And a woman that don't understand.

So tonight at the bar, I'll get in my car,
    G                         C
And take off for the Promised Land.


*Chorus*

F                                                C    Cmaj7    C
Drinkin' and dreamin', knowing damn well I can't go,
     G                                 C    Cmaj7    C
I'll never see Texas, L.A. or ol' Mexico.
    F                                            C    Cmaj7    C
But here at this table, I'm able to leave it behind.
  G                                                 C    Cmaj7    C
Drink till I'm dreamin', a thousand miles out of my mind.


*break*
G    G    C    C


C
This suit and this tie, is just a disguise,
F                 C
This ain't really me.

Some people are born to be tied down,
     G                      C
Some people are born to be free.


C
When I look down the road, she don't know,
F                      C
How it gets under my skin.

She's got my body, but my heart and soul,
    G                      C
Are out there riding the wind.


*Chorus*

F                                                C    Cmaj7    C
Drinkin' and dreamin', knowing damn well I can't go,
     G                                C    Cmaj7    C
I'll never see Texas, L.A. or ol' Mexico.
    F                                           C    Cmaj7    C
But here at this table, I'm able to leave it behind.
  G                                                 C    Cmaj7    C
Drink till I'm dreamin', a thousand miles out of my mind.


*Chorus*

F                                                C    Cmaj7    C
Drinkin' and dreamin', knowing damn well I can't go,
     G                                C    Cmaj7    C
I'll never see Texas, L.A. or ol' Mexico.
    F                                           C    Cmaj7    C
But here at this table, I'm able to leave it behind.
  G                                                 C    Cmaj7    C
Drink till I'm dreamin', a thousand miles out of my mind.
