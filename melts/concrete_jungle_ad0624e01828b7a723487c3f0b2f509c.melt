VERSE 1

Em          Am                Em
No sun will shine in my day today (no sun will shine)
                Am                    D
The high yellow moon wont come out to play (that high yellow moon wont come out to play)
       C                       Em
I said (darkness) darkness has covered my light
C                                    Em
(and has changed) and has changed my day into night, yeah
G                       D
Where is the love to be found?
                            Em                        Am              Em
Wont someone tell me? cause life (sweet life) must be somewhere to be found (must be 
for me)

CHORUS

Em
Instead of concrete jungle
Where the living is hardest
Concrete jungle
Man you got to do your best
