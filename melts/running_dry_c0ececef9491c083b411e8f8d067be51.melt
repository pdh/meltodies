Intro:
Dm      Dm(sus4) Dm       Dm(sus4) Dm

    Dm                                     F           Am(sus4)  Am
Oh, please help me, oh please help me, I'm livin' by myself.
  Dm                 C                   Am          Dm
I need someone to comfort me, I need someone to tell.

    F                         C
I'm sorry for the things I've done,
                        F     FaddG
I've shamed myself with lies,
    Dm                    C                     Am   Dm    
But soon these things are overcome and can't be recognized.
Dm(sus4) Dm       Dm(sus4) Dm

  Dm                               F                 Am(sus4)  Am
I left my love with ribbons on and water in her eyes.
  Dm                C                          Am        Dm
I took from her the love I'd won and turned it to the sky.

    F                         C
I'm sorry for the things I've done,
                        F     FaddG
I've shamed myself with lies,
    Dm         C                        Am      Dm    
My cruelty has punctured me and now I'm running dry.
Dm(sus4)  Dm  Dm(sus4)
