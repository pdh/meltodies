Intro:
F6  |  C  |  G  |  C  |  C  |  C  |  C  |

     C                    G
Last Saturday night I got married,
                      C
Me and my wife settled down.
               C7      F
Now me and my wife are parted;
      G                        C
Gonna take another stroll down-town.

C           G                  C
Irene, good-night. Irene, good-night.
             C7         F
Goodnight. I-rene. Good-night, Irene.
     G             C
I'll see you in my dreams.


Interlude:
F6 |  C  |  G  |  C  |  C  |  C  |  C  |

     C                   G
Some-times I live in the country.
                    C
Sometimes I live in town.
            C7          F
Sometimes I take a fool notion
   G                     C
To jumo in the river and drown.


C           G                   C
Irene, good-night. Irene, good-night.
             C7         F
Goodnight. I-rene. Good-night, Irene.
     G             C
I'll see you in my dreams.


Interlude:

|  F6  | C     G |   C   |   C   |

            C                    G
Stop you're ramblin', stop you're gamblin'.
                        C
Stop staying out late at night.
                C7      F
Go home to your wife and family.
     G                     C
Stay there by the fireside bright.


C           G                  C
Irene, good-night. Irene, good-night.
             C7         F
Goodnight. I-rene. Good-night, Irene.
     G             C       F6     C
I'll see you in my dreams.
