#1.
A               E     F#m             A
A smile on your face, but not in your eyes.
D                      A   D                   E
You're looking through me..you don't feel it inside.

Get out and ride on, baby, ride on, baby..

ride on, baby, ride on, baby.

#2.
        D                        E
I could pick your face out in an FBI file,
    D                     E
You may look pretty but I can't say the same
         A    E            A  E
for your mind......Ah, ah, ah.

#3.
A              E  F#m             A
You walk up to me and try to look shy.
D                  A    D                     E
The red round your eyes says that you ain't a child.

CHORUS:

#4.
           D                    E
Well, I've seen your face, in a trashy magazine.
    D                                    E
You know where you're going, but I don't like the places
       A    E            A  E       
you've been......Ah, ah, ah.. 

A E F#m A    D A D E

I can pick your face out from the front or behind.
    D                      E                           A   E
You may look pretty, but I can't say the same for your mind.
        A  E
Ah, ah, ah.

#6.

Laugh it up a bit. Give it a try.

If I'm not impressed, you can still cry.

CHORUS:

#7.
       D                                    E
By the time you're thirty, gonna look sixty-five.
    D                           E
You won't look pretty, and your friends will have
               A  E
kissed you goodbye.

CHORUS:
