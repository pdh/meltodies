C      Cmaj7
Motion pictures
   C7
on my TV screen,
F
A home away from home,
F#/D
livin' in between

Repeat same chord pattern for entire song:
C Cmaj7 C7 F F#/D 


But I hear some people
have got their dream.
I've got mine.

I hear the mountains
are doin' fine,
Mornin' glory
is on the vine,
And the dew is fallin',
the ducks are callin'.
Yes, I've got mine.

Well, all those people,
they think
they got it made
But I wouldn't buy,
sell, borrow or trade
Anything I have
to be like one of them.
I'd rather
start all over again.

Well, all those headlines,
they just bore me now
I'm deep inside myself,
but I'll get out somehow,
And I'll stand before you,
and I'll bring
a smile to your eyes.
Motion pictures,
motion pictures.

P.S.
I'm desperate for a TAB of Ambulance Blues, there are only Chords to it here.
