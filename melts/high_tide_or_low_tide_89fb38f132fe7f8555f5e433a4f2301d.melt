She was praying in the night
And the words that she [Bm]said 
(the words that she [F#m]said)
They still-a lingers [Bm]in my head 
She said: [C#7.]"A child is born in this world,
He needs pro[F#m]tection. Wo-oh, mm.
God, guide and pro[Bm]tect us.
[F#m]When we're wrong, [Bm]please correct us [D]
And [E]stand by me," yeah!

[F#m]Mm. I said, I heard my mother;
