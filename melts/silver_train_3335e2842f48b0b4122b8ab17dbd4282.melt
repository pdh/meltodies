SILVER TRAIN	By Keith Richards &amp; Mick Jaggar	Tabbed by Jamie Mayer

From the ROLLING STONES album GOATS HEAD SOUP,  another version can be found on JOHNNY WINTER'S  STILL 
AND WELL.  Hopefully this can be posted under both as there is really not much to be found under Johnny Winter.


The main riff goes as follows and is played at the beginning and many times throughout

Silver train kept a comin, Think I'm gonna get on down, Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah
Silver train kept a comin, Think I'm gonna get on down, Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah
Silver rain kept a fallin, Fallin up around my house, Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah
Silver rain kept a fallin, Fallin up around my house, Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah,  And I


D 	                G
did not know her name,  no I

D		G
Did not know her name, but I

C		       D			G
Sure like the way she left when she called me honey

	Some of the words are hard to make out and there is a lot more guitar than the riff above but this is 
the song.
