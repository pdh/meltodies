C              C7            F            C
We're the best partners this world's ever seen 
G                              C
Together we're as close as can be 
C                  C7           F            
But sometimes it's hard to find time in between 
G                            C
To tell you what you mean to me 

CHORUS
C           C7         F 
You are the rose of my heart 
G                      C  
You are the love of my life
C            C7        F 
A flower not faded nor falling apart 
          C                           G
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm 
           C
Rose of my Heart. 

C           C7           F            C 
When sorrow holds you in it's arms of clay
     G                             C 
It's raindrops that fall from your eyes
C                 C7          F 
Your smile is the sun come to earth for a day
C                           G 
You brighten my blackest of skies
 
CHORUS
C           C7         F 
You are the rose of my heart 
G                      C  
You are the love of my life
C            C7        F 
A flower not faded nor falling apart 
          C                           G
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm 
           C
Rose of my Heart. 

C                 C7          F         C
So hard times are easy times, what do I care
G                               C 
There's nothing I'd change if I could
C                 C7           F 
The tears and the laughter are things that we share 
G                          C
Your hand in mine makes it good 

CHORUS
C           C7         F 
You are the rose of my heart 
G                      C  
You are the love of my life
C            C7        F 
A flower not faded nor falling apart 
          C                           G
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm 
           C
Rose of my Heart. 

C           C7         F 
You are the rose of my heart 
G                      C  
You are the love of my life
C            C7        F 
A flower not faded nor falling apart 
          C                           G
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm 
           C
Rose of my Heart.
