Song: I've Got Rights by Hank Williams Jr.

Hello Everyone. This is my first tab so if something is out of place
then ...oops! I chose this song because it has yet to be tabbed and it is
super easy. Not to mention a great song. You should all know these chords
by now so I will not post the chord breakdowns. Have fun with it. Peace

Verse 1

D                  C           G
I went down to the Mary Carter paint store
       D                   C                G
I said give me one of them Smith and Wesson magnum forty fours
D                            C                 G
Cause there's a man that the law let loose and justice was not done
F        G                     C           D
This man killed my wife and my only little son
D                 C          G
I'll never forget the way he looked all through the trial
D                    C             G
He had his big named lawyer and he had that smirkey smile
D          C                G
Oh yeah he got you off on a technicality
F                       G                C                  D
But you'll have to grow wings and fly to ever get away from me


Chorus                                
            G                   D
Cause I got rights I got rights too
C                            G                  F                 D
And this time there won't be no damn lawyer and system to protect you
             G                                 D
But I'm gonna read you I'm gonna read you your rights
          C                  G                 F
You gotta right to know that you're gonna go to hell one of these black 
D
nights


Verse 2

D                  C                        G
When the trial was over he had the nerve to say that's the way it goes
D                           C
I said well hoss you better get you some corks 
             G
Cause you're gonna have to plug up a few holes
D                      C       G
Guess he thought I was talkin' just to pass away time
F                  G                    C                     D
But it kinda looks different now on his knees beggin' for his life


Chorus
          G                        D
Hey I got rights I got some rights too...
   C                     G                   F               D
No this time there ain't no damn lawyers and systems to save you
