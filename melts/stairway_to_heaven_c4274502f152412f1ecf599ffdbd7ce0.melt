Verse 1:                   
		
C		D
There’s a lady who’s sure,
		F		Am
All that glitters is gold.
		C		G		Am
And she’s buying a Stairway to Heaven.
		C		  D
When she gets there she knows,
	    F			Am
If the stores are all closed,
	   C			G		   Am
With a word she can get what she came for.
		C		G	    Am
And she’s buying a Stairway to Heaven.

Little part between verses:
C	D	F	Am
C	G	Am

Verse 2:

C		D
There’s a sign on the wall,
	     F	    Am
But she wants to be sure.
		C			G		Am
‘Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
	C		D
In a tree by the brook,
		F		Am
There’s a songbird who sings,
		C		G		Am
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

Bridge 1:

Am7/G  Am7  D/E  D
And it makes me wonder...
				Am7/G  Am7  Em-D-C-D
And it makes me wonder...

Verse 3:

C	   Am7
There’s a feeling I get,
	   Am
When I look to the West.
	    C		G		Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
	    C			Am7
In my thoughts I have seen,
		Am
Rings of smoke through the trees,
		C	  G			Am
And the voices of those who stand looking.

Bridge 1

Verse 4:

		C		Am7	
And it’s whispered that soon,
	Am
If we all call the tune,
		C	    G		   Am
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
	C		   Am7
And a new day will dawn,
	Am
For those who stand long,
		C		G		Am
And the forests will echo with laughter.

Bridge 2:

Solo:

Over chords: Am  G  F  G
Ad lib

Verse 5:

Am		G			F	G
And as we wind on down the road,
Am		   G			F	G
Our shadows taller than our souls,
Am		    G		    	F	G
There walks a lady we all know,
Am			G			F	G
Who shines white light and wants to show,
Am		G			  F	G
How everything still turns to gold.
Am		G		F	G
And if you listen very hard,
Am		   G			F	G
The tune will come to you at last.
Am	    G			F
To be a rock and not a roll.

N.C.
And she’s buying a Stairway to Heaven.

Little “finishing-touch” solo


	
NOTE: These are not the same chords a single guitarist will be playing.  This was
all done using the harmonics of each chord.  So if someone tells you, “You’re
playing it wrong,” tell them to play along and it will match.  I promise.
That should just about do it.  If you’re a rhythm player and you don’t wanna be
left out when the band starts playing this song, then this is for you.  I didn’t
tab the solos because I play lead guitar and I wouldn’t want anybody just copying
my solos.  It’s not fair to take those from Jimmy Page.  They’re a part of him
and he’s a part of them.  So I’ll leave that to the imagination (after all, it’s
always improvised anyway).
