Intro | Dsus2 D | D/C C | C/G G | C/G G :||



            G                     C
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
          D/C    C    G   C/G G
And it's Eastertime too

And your gravity fails
          C     D/C       C     G     C/G  G
And negativity don't pull you through
      C
Don't put on any airs
                                 G
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
              D7
They got some hungry women there 
                                 G   C/G  G
And they really make a mess outa you.





       G
Now if you see Saint Annie
C              D/C    C   G  C/G  G
Please tell her thanks a lot

I cannot move
    C           D/C C   G   C/G  G
My fingers are all in a knot
  C
I don't have the strength
                            G
To get up and take another shot
    D7
And my best friend, my doctor
                           G        C/G  G
Won't even say what it is I've got.







G
Sweet Melinda
     C                               G     C/G  G
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom

She speaks good English
         C               D/C C  G     C/G  G
And she invites you up into her room
     C
And you're so kind
                                 G   C/G  G
And careful not to go to her too soon
     D7
And she takes your voice
                              G        C/G  G
And leaves you howling at the moon.





        G
Up on Housing Project Hill
C                       G
It's either fortune or fame

You must pick up one or the other
         C             D/C    C           G      C/G  G
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
           C
If you're lookin' to get silly
                                       G  C/G  G
You better go back to from where you came
            D7
Because the cops don't need you
                         G    C/G  G
And man they expect the same.





      G
Now all the authorities
C                  D/C   C   G   C/G  G
They just stand around and boast
                                       C
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
      D/C      C  G    C/G G
Into leaving his post
    C 
And picking up Angel who
                              G  C/G  G
Just arrived here from the coast
            D7
Who looked so fine at first
                            G        C/G  G
But left looking just like a ghost.

   G
I started out on burgundy
    C             D/C C  G   C/G G
But soon hit the harder stuff
                               C
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
         D/C   C     G    C/G  G
When the game got rough
         C
But the joke was on me
                                 G  C/G  G
There was nobody even there to bluff
             D7
I'm going back to New York City
                       G        C/G   G
I do believe I've had enough.
