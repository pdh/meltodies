Verse:
          G            D           G     G7
They were playing that old country waltz

        C         Em              Am     Am
In this empty bar echoing off the wall,

       C             Em            D          C12
When I first got the bad news that you set me free,

    G               D           C C/B C/A G
The band played the old country waltz to  me.


Verse:
        G (rest)     D (rest)    G      G7
Well, I loved, and I lost, and I cried,
The day that the two of us died,
Ain't got no excuses, I just want to ride,
While the band plays the old country waltz.


Instrumental (as intro):


Bridge:
        C          C
Out the window the moon shines

       G            G7
On the roofs of the cars,

        C          C           G  D
While I knock down tequila and sa-lt,

        G              D           C C/B C/A G
And the band plays the old country waltz.


Verse:
          G (rest)         D (rest)    G      G7
And we're playing it, that old country waltz,
In this empty bar echoing off the wall,
Ain't got no excuses, we just want to play
That good old country waltz,

I ain't got no excuses, I just want to play
That good old country waltz,

     G        D       Em   C   G
That good old country waltz.
