Gonna shoot somebody jus' to watch him die

He been on the job too long

Duncan, Duncan was tending the bar
'Long came Brady with his shiny star
"Duncan," said Brady, "you are under arrest"
Duncan shot a hole right in Brady's chest
He been on the job too long.

Old King Brady was a big, fat man
Doctor looked down, and took hold of his hand
reached for his pulse, the doctor said
"I believe to my soul, king Brady, you're dead"
He been on the job too long

Up upon the hillside, eight hundred at hand,
vases of roses standing around
[...] horses and a rubber-tired hack
bring him down to the graveyard, it won't bring him back.
He been on the job too long

When the women all heard King Brady was dead,
They went home and they'd be back in red [raggin' red?]
Slippin' and a-slidin', shuffelin' down the street,
In their big mother hubbards and their stockin' feet.
He been on the job too long

"Brady, Brady, Brady, you know you done wrong
breakin' in here when this game's  goin' on
Bustin' down the window, tearin' down the door
Now you lyin' dead on the barroom floor
You been on the job too long."

Twinkle, twinkle, little star
'Long comes Brady in his 'lectric car
Got a mean look in his eye
Gonna shoot somebody jus' to watch him die
He been on the job too long.
   G                   C
He been on the job too long.
