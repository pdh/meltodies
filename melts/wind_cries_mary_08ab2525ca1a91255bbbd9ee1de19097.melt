       Wind Cries Mary
         Jimi hendrix


D                                 C
After all the jacks are in their boxes 
D                                 C
And the clowns have all gone to bed
D                       C                      G
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
D            C          G         
Footprints dressed in red 
A                      G        Em           Am
And the wind whispers Mary

D                     C
A broom is drearily sweeping 
D                         C    
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
D                      C     
Somewhere a queen is weeping 
D            C           G 
Somewhere a king has no wife
A                     G         Em         Am
And the wind It cries Mary

D                                     C 
The traffic lights They turn of blue tomorrow
D                                    C
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
D                C        G
The tiny island sails on downstream 
D                   C        G
Cause the life that lived is dead
A                    G            Em        Am
And the wind screams Mary

Solo chords: (I just play the verse)

D                  C         
Will the wind ever remember 
D                              C
The names it has blown in the past
              D               C           G
And with this crush It's old age And it's wisdom
            D            C      G
It whispers No This will be the last
A                  G                  Em      Am
And the wind cries Mary
               
     To be honest... I was just jammin, and came with this.
