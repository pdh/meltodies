Monkey Man transcribed by John Goddard

               E
I'm a flea-bit peanut monkey, all my friends are junkies
 C#       C#sus4      C#     C#sus4
(that's not really true)
               E
I'm a cold Italian pizza, I could use a lemon squeezer
 C#       C#sus4      C#     C#sus4
(like you do)
                         A
I've been bit and I've been tossed around
     B
by every she-cat in this town
    C#       C#sus4      C#     C#sus4
(have you babe?)
A                                                                    B
I am just a monkey man I'm glad you are a monkey woman too

 C#       C#sus4      C#     C#sus4

         E
I was bitten by a boar, I was gouged and I was gored
 C#       C#sus4      C#     C#sus4
(I went along too)
E
I'm a sack of broken eggs, I always have an unmade bed
 C#       C#sus4      C#     C#sus4
(don't you?)
          A                                                                        B
Well I hope we're not too Messianic or a trifle too satanic
 C#       C#sus4      C#     C#sus4
(love to play the blues)
A                                                            B
