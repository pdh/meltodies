************* SILENT PARTNERS **************

written by Bobby Braddock

performed by Waylon Jennings


Verse 1:
             E
	He stands in the doorway,his hands upon his hips

	She stands by the jukebox,a sweet smile on her lips

	He slowly walks up to her,she reaches out for him

	It's almost like some magnet is pulling both of them
                 B
	Then he says...
	         A
	And she says...


Chorus:
          E
	Silent partners,they don't say a word

	She is the adjective and he is the verb
               A
	They speak with their bodies and they talk with their eyes
                              B                            A
	They don't make no promises so they don't tell no lies
                   E
	Silent partners

	Silent partners


Verse 2:
            E
	Later in their love-nest at half-past ecstasy

	They cling to each other and lie there silently

	She would like to tell him what she feels in her heart

	And he would like to bare his soul

	But don't know where to start
               B
	So he says...
                 A
	And she says...


Chorus.


Chorus (last half of it).
