HARD HEADED WOMAN
(Cat Stevens)

Dm    G                         C
  I'm looking for a hard headed woman
Cm                F        Dm   Am
  One who'll take me for myself
Bb         G       C           F
  And if I find my hard headed woman
Bb           C        F         Am
  I won't need nobody else, no, no, no

  I'm looking for a hard headed woman
  One who'll make me do my best
  And if I find my hard headed woman
  I know the rest of my life will be blessed, yes, yes, yes

     Dm   G                  C
       I know a lot of fancy dancers
     Cm               F              Dm    Am/F
       People who can glide you on a floor
     Bb        F          Bb          F    C
       They move so smooth but have no answers
     Gm            C                          F  Am
       When you ask "why'd you come here for?"
     Am             D              Am
       I know, many fine feathered friends
                 D               F       E          A
       but their friendliness depends on how you do

Dm     G                        C
  I'm looking for a hard headed woman
Cm               F           Dm   Am  F
  one who'll make me feel so good
Bb     F  Bb            F      C
  And if I find my hard headed woman
Gm          C                  F            Am
  I know my life will be as it should, yes, yes, yes
