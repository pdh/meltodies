D                         G           D
I been a-havin' some hard travellin', I thought you knowed,
                                      A7
I been a-havin' some hard travellin', way down the road,
D                    D7               G              G7
I been a-havin' some hard travellin', hard ramblin', hard gamblin',
D                   A               D
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord.

I been ridin' them fast rattlers, I thought you knowed
I been ridin' them flat wheelers way down the road
I been ridin' them dead enders, blind passengers, pickin' up cinders
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord.

I been hittin' some hard rock minin', I thought you knowed,
I been a-leanin' on a pressure drill, way down the road,
Hammer flyin', air hose suckin', six feet of mud, I sure been a-muckin'
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord.

I been hittin' some hard harvestin', I thought you knowed,
North Dakota to Kansas City, way down the road.
Cut that wheat and stack that hay, tryin' to make about a dollar a day,
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord.

I been a-workin' that Pittsburg steel, I thought you knowed,
I been a-pourin' that red-hot slag, way down the road,
I been a-blastin', I been a-firin', I been a-pourin' red-hot iron,
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord.

Oh, I've been locked in a hard rock jail, I thought you knowed.
I've been layin' out ninety days, way down the road.
The mean old judge he says to me, "That's a-ninety days for vagrancy."
An' I've been hittin' some hard travelin', Lawd.

I been walkin' that Lincoln Highway, I thought you knowed,
I been a-hittin' that sixty-six, way down the road,
Heavy load and worried mind, lookin' for a woman that's hard to find,
I been hittin' some hard travellin', Lord.
