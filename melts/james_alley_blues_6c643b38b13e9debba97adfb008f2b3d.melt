James Alley Blues - Bob Dylan 

(tune to Drop D)



[long intro over a D chord]

D          /A/B        /C   /B    D
Times ain't  what they used to be,
G/B                   /C   /B  D
Times ain't what they used to be. 
            A                   G/B           /C      /B   D
Well, I'm a-tellin' it, people, Lord, you can take it from me.
