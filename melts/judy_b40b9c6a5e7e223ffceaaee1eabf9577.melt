INTRO: A D

#1.
D
You came down out of Heaven to make me 
       A
happy, dear.
         E       A
To smile away my sorrows and kiss away 
   D
my tears.
      A           D
Seems that I have loved you though we've 
            A
never met before.
               E     A
But now you're in my heart, love, to stay 
        D
for evermore.

CHORUS:
D                                A            
You're my angel, Judy, you're my darlin'..
A
you're the sweetest flower that Heaven ever 
D
grew.
D                          A
My arms could never hold another, cause my 
                 D
love is only for you.


INTERLUDE: G A D

#2.
D               A        D
The nights were dark and lonely, the days were 
G       A
lonely, too.
                E      A                   E
But now they're all so bright, love, cause all 
  A      D
I see is you.

#3.
D             A      D                   A
You came down out of Heaven, from out of empty 

space.
              A       E     A            E
With a song upon your lips, dear, with a smile 
  A       D
upon your face.

OUTRO:
D                                A            
You're my angel, Judy, you're my darlin'..
A
you're the sweetest flower that Heaven ever 
D
grew.
D                          A
My arms could never hold another, cause my 
        G        D   A D
love is only for you.
