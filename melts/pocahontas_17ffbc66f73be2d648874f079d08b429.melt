Pocahontas : Rust Never Sleeps/Neil Young

 (C tuning)

Open C Strumming (accent on bottom strings)

 C
 Aurora Borealis
     C
 The icy sky at night
  Dm
 Paddles cut the water
      Dm
 In a long and hurried flight
         G7          riff                C
 From the white man to the fields of green
          G7          riff         C
 and the homeland we've never seen

C strumming Accenting on bottom strings

 They killed us in our teepees
 And they cut our women down
 They might have left some babies
 Cryin' on the ground
 But the firesticks and the wagons come
 And the night falls on the settin' sun

  C C Dm G7 riff C

 They massacred the buffalo
 Kitty corner from the bank
 The taxis run across my feet
 And my eyes have turned to blanks
 In my little box at the top of the stairs
 With my indian rug and a pipe to share

 I wish I was a trapper
 I would give a thousand pelts
 To sleep with Pocahontas
 and find out how she felt
 In the mornin' on the fields of green
 In the homeland we've never seen

  C

 And maybe Marlon Brando
 Will be there by the fire
 We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
 And the good things there for hire
 And the Astradome and the first teepee
 Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
 Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me

Tab memo:
The riff is more strummed than picked as it replaces the chord. Make sure you get that open C note at the 
of the riff. At first it is a bit difficult to sing at the same time but you get the hang of it. There is 
some lead picking inbetween the verses which is pretty easy to work out if you play along with the record. There are mistakes in there and what I call a G7 or a Dm isn?t  a sure thing all I know is that it works, 
some one could correct me on these things it would be greatly appreciated. Another great song from Mr Young.
