               E                        A
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
               E                       B7
Someday you'll reach for me I won't be there
                 E                       A
For you've grown tired of all the love I gave you
        E          B7                E
But someday you'll wish that I still care.


B7                       E
All these years how I've loved you
        F#                      B7
Still I know I claim you for my own
               E                        A
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
        E          B7             E
For someday you'll find yourself alone.


         E                            A
When you hair has turned from Gold to Silver
         E                          B7
And your eyes are dimmed by passing years
         E                     A
You'll remember darling what I told you
            E      B7               E
There'll be no one then to dry your tears.
    

B7                           E
There'll come a time in your life dear
            F#                    B7
When you'll need someone who will care
               E                        A
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
        E          B7                E
For someday you'll find that I'm not there.
