Chorus:
	F	       C
She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady
G			 C
spendin' her days on the train
	F			 C
She's a semi-good-looker but the fast rails they took her
	  G	            G7	     C
now she's tryin', tryin' to get home again


Verse 1:
C				F	       C
South station in Boston, to the stock yards of Austin
					       G
from the Florida sunshine, to the New Orlean's rain
C				F		C
Now that the rail &lt;mumble&gt; have taken the &lt;mumble mumble&gt;
      G				 C
She's tryin', tryin' to get home again

Chorus:
She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady
spendin' her days on the train
Once a pullen car traveller, the switchmen won't have her
She's tryin', tryin' to get home again

Verse 2:
Once a high born loaner, thought he could own her
he bought her a fur coat and a big diamond ring
but she &lt;mumble&gt; him for cold cash
in the town &lt;mumble mumble&gt; there
Never thinkin', never thinkin' of home way back then

Verse 3 (KEY-CHANGE: same chord pattern but in the key of D!):

But the rails are now rusty, and the diamond got dusty
and the gold plated watches have taken their toll
And the railroads are dyin', and the lady is cryin'
on a bus to Kentucky at home that's her goal

Chorus (still in D):
She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady
spendin' her days on the train
She's a semi-good-looker but the fast rails they took her
now she's tryin', tryin' to get home again
     D			G    A    D
On a bus to Kentucky at home once again
