Intro:
C


Chorus:
         F
From the bells of St Mary
       C
To the Count of Monte Cristo
G
Nothing can stop, nothing can stop
                    F          C 
Nothin can stop the sins of Memphisto




G
Sally used to play with her hula hoops
F
Now she tells her problems to therapy groups
G
Grampa's on the front lawn staring at a rake
F
Wondering if his marriage was a terrible mistake
G
I'm sitting on the front steps drinking orange crush
F
Wondering if it's possible if I could still blush
   C
Uh huh  Oh yeah



G
Boy on a bike with corduroy slacks
F
leeps in the river by the railroad tracks
G
He waits for the whistle on the train to scream
F
So he can close his eyes and begin to dream
   C
Uh huh  Oh yeah



(Repeat Chorus)




G
The hands on his watch spin slowly around
         F
With his mind on a bus that goes all over town
G
Looking at the babies and the factories
F
Listening to the music of Mister Squeeze
G
As if by magic or remote control
   F
He finds a piece of a puzzle that he missed in his soul
   C
Uh huh  Oh yeah



(Repeat Chorus)



G
Adam and Eve and Lucy and Ricky
F
Bit the big apple and got a little sticky
G
Esmeralda and the Hunchback of Notre Dame
F
They humped each other like they had no shame
G
They paused as they posed for a Polaroid photo
F
She whispered in his ear Exactly Odo,  Quasimoto


(Repeat Chorus)


G
Sally used to play with her hula hoops
F
Now she tells her problems to therapy groups
   C
Uh huh  Oh yeah
