#1.
E
I said hello to the man that tried to win your hand..
  B  
a long time ago.

I tried to smile, as he talked of the days..
        E
when he was your beau.
    
But I could see he was a-shamin’ me
        A
when he talked of his wealth and fame..
                               E
Ruby Ann took the hand of this poor, poor man,
      B                 E
ain’t true love a funny thing?

CHORUS:
    A                                   E
Big man, you got money in your hand..So what?
            A
You’re at a table for two, but still there’s only you..
    B
Big shot!

#2.
           E
Well, your money can’t buy, if your power can’t hold,
                       A
you can’t romance your fame..
                               E
Ruby Ann took the hand of this poor, poor man,
      B                 E
ain’t true love a funny thing?

CHORUS:
    A                                   E
Big man, you got money in your hand..So what?
            A
You’re at a table for two, but still there’s only you..
    B
