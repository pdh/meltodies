Desolation Row
Bob Dyaln
Highway 61 Revisited


E
They're Sellin Postcards of the hanging

A                               E
They're painting the passports brown

B7
The Beauty parlor is full of sailors

A                E
THe circus is in town

Here Comes The blind commisioner

A                      E
they've got him in a trance

B7
One hand is tied to the tightrope walker

A                    E
the other is in his pants

A
The riot squad they're restless

E
They need somewhere to go

                         B7
As lady and I Look out tonight on to

A            E
Desolation Row


this is how the whole song goes.  i found that if you plan on playing this with 
just a plain B will work.
