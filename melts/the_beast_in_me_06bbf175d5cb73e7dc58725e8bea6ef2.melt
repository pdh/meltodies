CAPO 3

hold the chord and pick the melody, I've marked when to stop picking,
at that point you revert to regular strumming. 
The man in black picks the B7 chord as well (same melody as the A chord),
when i play the song i do too, but it sounds just as good when you don't.

Intro:  melody of A and E, 
        followed by the base note of A (pick the open A string once 1x) (see melody)

(pause)       A
The beast in me
D             E                A
Is caged by frail and fragile bars
D             E  (end melody)
Restless by day
         A               G            B7 
And by night rants and rages at the stars
D (melody)   E           A
God help,    The beast in me



(pause)       A
The beast in me
D            E                  A      
Has had to learn to live with pain
D            E                  A 
And how to shelter from the rain
D               E (end melody)            
And in the twinkling of an 
A             G             B7
eye   might have to be restrained
D (melody)   E           A
God help,    The beast in me



C#
Sometimes it tries to kid me
D
That it's just a teddy bear
C#
And even somehow manage 
A
to vanish in the air
E
And that's when i must beware



(pause)          A
Of the beast in me
D          E      A
That everybody knows
 D                  E (end melody)     
They've seen him outdressed in my      
  A          G         B7
clothes   patently   unclear
D(melody)  E          A
Is it New York or new year
D               E           A
God help,      The beast in me




Allright, that's the complete song, enjoy!!
