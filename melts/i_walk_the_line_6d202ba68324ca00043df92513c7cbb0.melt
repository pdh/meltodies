I Walk the Line
Johnny Cash

A        E7                           A
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
A         E7                     A
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
A          D                         A
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
A              E7               A
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
