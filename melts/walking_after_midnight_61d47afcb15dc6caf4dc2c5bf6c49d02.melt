 Verse1:
 A
 I go out walking after midnight 
        D       D
 Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
     A          D     E       A
 I'm always walking after midnight searching for you
        A 
 I walk for miles along the highway 
           D      D
 Well that's just my way of saying I love you
       A        D     E       A  A7   
 I'm always walking after midnight searching for you


 Chorus:
              D
 I stopped to see a weeping willow 
           A                     
 Crying on his pillow maybe he's crying for me
     D
 And as the skies turn gloomy 
                  A           E
 Night Winds whisper to me I'm lonesome as I can be
 
 verse2:
      A                   D
 I go out walking after midnight out in the starlight 
                     A             D     E       A
 Just hoping that maybe you're somewhere walking after midnight searching for me

 
 Chorus:
        D
 I stopped to see a weeping willow 
           A
 Crying on his pillow maybe he's crying for me
   D
 And as the skies turn gloomy 
      A            A           E
 Night winds whisper to me I'm lonesome as I can be

 Verse3:
          A               D
 I go out walking after midnight out in the moonlight 
   D                          A        D    E        A 
Just hoping that maybe you're somewhere walking after midnight searching for me
