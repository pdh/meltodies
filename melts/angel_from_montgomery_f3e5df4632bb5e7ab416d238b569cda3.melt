There are so many versions...I like this one with the B7


E           A     E              A
I am an old woman named after my mother
E             A        B7          E
My old man is another child that's grown old
E               A       E                A
If dreams were thunder lightning was desire
E                          A            B7       E
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago


Chorus:
E           D           A        E
Make me an angel that flies from montgomery
E          D            A   E
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
E             D             A          E
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
E                   A               B7          E
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

Verse 2:

E             A                  E        A
When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
E                   A             B7            E
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
E                    A       E             A
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
E               A              B7          E
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.


(Repeat chorus/interlude)


Verse 3:
E                     A             E              A
There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
E                 A               B7      E
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
E                   A     E                 A
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
E                A                B7         E
Come home in the evening and have nothing to say?


(Repeat chorus)
