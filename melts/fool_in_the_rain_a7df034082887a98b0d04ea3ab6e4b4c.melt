Intro:  (C- D- E-F Am-G) x4

                C  -  D - E - F        Am  -  G               C - D  - E  -  F   Am   -   G
Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining, like a star that can't wait for the night
C- D- E   -  F         Am  -  G         C - D  - E   -  F      Am-G
  I hate to think I've been blinded baby,  why can't I see you tonight?
         C  -   D - E  - F     Am   -  G                  C -  D - E -  F    Am   -   G
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin', and the thrill of your touch gives me fright
          C- D - E -F     Am   -  G                       C - D - E-F      Am - G
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning, why don't you show up,   make it all right?
C- D- E-F Am-G      C- D - E - F  Am-G   C- D- E-F Am-G    C- D- E-F  Am-G
               Yeah, it's all right

             C- D -  E  -  F   Am   -  G               C  -  D -  E - F     Am -G
And if you promised you'd love so completely, and you said you would always be true
      C -   D -  E   -    F Am - G               C - D- E -F       Am -G
You swore that you would never leave me, baby, what ever  happened to you?
          C             F       G              C              F                 G
And you thought it was only in movies, as you wish all your dreams would come true
C              F            G              C           F            G
It ain't the first time believe me, baby, I'm standin here feeling blue
C- D- E-F Am-G              C- D- E-F Am-G   C- D- E-F Am-G    C- D- E-F Am-G
               Yeah I'm blue

             C -  D- E - F   Am   -  G                      C- D- E  - F   Am - G
Now I will stand in the rain on the corner, I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
  C- D - E - F     Am - G      C -   D - E - F      Am-G
Another ten minutes no longer, and then I'm turning around, round
      C           F              G            C        F             G
The clock on the wall's moving slower, oh my heart it sinks to the ground
          C            F                 G                C            F            G
And the storm that I thought would blow over, clouds the light of the love that I found
C- D- E-F Am-G                           C- D- E-F  Am-G
Found...      light of the love that I found
                           C- D- E-F Am-G             C- D- E-F  Am-G
Light of the love that I found            Oh that I found             [whistle]

Bridge:  (C F Am G) x10    (C F Am G) x4
                        ohh
        C         F           Am   G C    F    Am   G    C  F Am           G         C F Am G  C F Am G
Oooh, hand that ticks on the clock, just don't seem to stop,    when I'm thinking it over
C F Am G C F Am G C    F       Am   G     C   F     Am   G  C F Am G          C F Am G C F Am G C F Am G
Oooh....         tired of the light,  I just don't seem to find,    have you wait,    get away
C F Am G   C F Am G   C F Am G   C F Am G
Whoa oooh
   C  F         Am  G         C        F  Am    G        C
I see it in my dreams, but I just don't seem to be with you
F  G     F           C F G  C           C F G C            C F G      F          C F G F (C F G F) x5
  You I gotta get it all, gotta get it all,  gotta get it all,  I've got to get all....

Awesome solo over: (C- D- E-F Am-G) x20

        C -  D - E- F   Am -G               C  -  D- E -F     Am  -  G
Now my body is starting to quiver, and the palms of my hands getting wet
 C -  D - E - F    Am -G               C -  D- E -F   Am - G
I've got no reason to doubt you baby, it's all a terrible mess
          C - D - E- F         Am - G                    C -  D -  E  - F       Am- G
And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless, when I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey
       C  -   D- E-F          Am- G                    C  -  D- E -F        Am  - G
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless, I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah
C F G               (C F G) x4
      Hey now, ohhhh
                           C  F G                             C  F G
Light of the love that I found     light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I           light of the love that I found
Light of the love, hey now         light of the love, hey now
Light of the love that I found     light of the love that I found
