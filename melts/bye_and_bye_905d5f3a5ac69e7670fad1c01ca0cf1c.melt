Well, it's A for the Ark, was a wonderful boat
                             E
Build it on land, you'll get water there to float
A               A7            D
And B for the B beast, at the ending of the wood
        A             E              A
We will understand it better bye and bye
Scale Walk Up
              A
Children it's bye, bye, better bye and bye
                      B              E
We will understand it better bye and bye.
              A
Children it's bye, bye, better bye and bye
                      E              A
We will understand it better bye and bye.
