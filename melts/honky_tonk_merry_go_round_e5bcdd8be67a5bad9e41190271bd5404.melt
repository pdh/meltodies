Honky Tonk Merry Go Round, by Patsy Cline
(recorded circa 50's/early 60's)
Written by Frank Simon and Stan Gardner  *Note: also heard that
P. Mitchell/P. Bunch wrote it.  So far I haven't found out
which ones actually did.  If you know (for sure,) please let me know. 

Key G, capo on 2nd fret to play with youtube video.
 
G                   D        G
I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round 
            C       G
Making ever spot in town
D
Starting out early  coming home late
G                  D  
Every night with a brand new date
 
G                   D        G
I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round
              C       G
Acting like a foolish clown
D
Still racing those blues that you left with me
G                 D       G   G7
Wondering if I'll ever be free
 
C                             
Round and around and around I go
G 
Riding high and feeling low
A7
Round and around just like a top
     D
Well I'm a getting dizzy but I can't stop
 
G                   D        G
I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round
              C       G
Acting like a foolish clown
D
Still racing those blues that you left with me
G                 D       G
Wondering if I'll ever be free
