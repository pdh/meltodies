Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere chords
Neil Young

G C G C G  C G C G

  G       
I think I'd like to go
C    G
back home
C           G   C G
And take it easy
          G    
There's a woman that
                C  G
I'd like to get to know
C      G    C G
Living there

C                  G
Everybody seems to wonder
Em                  A
What it's like down here
  C
I gotta get away
            
from this day-to-day
         Am
running around,
          C   
Everybody knows
        G          
this is nowhere.

G     D        C
La la la la la la la
G     D        C
La la la la la la la

G C G C G  C G C G

G 
Every time I think about
C    G
back home
     C        G     C G
It's cool and breezy
  G                 
I wish that I could be there
C     G  
right now
C            G   C G
Just passing time.

C                  G
Everybody seems to wonder
Em                  A
What it's like down here
  C
I gotta get away
            
from this day-to-day
         Am
running around,
          C   
Everybody knows
        G          
this is nowhere.

G     D        C
La la la la la la la
G     D        C
La la la la la la la   4x
