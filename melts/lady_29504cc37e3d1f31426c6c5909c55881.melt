C    Am      C                Am            F                         C
Lady... your arms were always warm and your bed was always ready when I came
C   Am      C             Am
Lady in the middle of the night
          Dm                 D7                G
You would open up when you'd hear me call your name
             C               Em      F             C
And you were always there to see the turning of my key
         F                               G
And your laughing voice to me was like a song
C    Am      C                  Am        F               G               C
Lady... your spirit's sweet and free it's hanging on with me now that I'm gone

Lady... you spoke softly and kind and you never had a word to criticize
C   Am   C           Am          Dm               D7         G 
Lady you know I love you so even more than I ever let you realize
    C              Em                F               C
And day or night I knew that I could bring it all to you
       F                              G
And if I was wrong you'd never put me down
C    Am         C               Am      F                G               C
Lady... there's so much I could say but I can't find the way to write it down
