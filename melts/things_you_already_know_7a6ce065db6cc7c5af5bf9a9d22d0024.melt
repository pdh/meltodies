VERSE:
Bm
Grab that wheel
Bm                                       E
And I'll sail you 'round the world in my yacht
Cm        F#
Oh I've got it girl
B     A#m     G#m     F#m      C#m                F#           B
I can promise you the moon and stars, if you just give me your heart.

VERSE 2:
Bm
See there,
Bm                                      E
Over there, just back beyond the changing room
Cm      F#
Yeah those two
B      A#m          G#m     F#m       C#m        F#        B
Think they got it made, like I do, aren't they jealous of you.

CHORUS:
Em                  B             F#m               E
And don't bother to question, the thing you already know...
                B
Like I love you so!

VERSE 3:
Sundown,
And the maids got their fists up in the air
Oh they're everywhere
I'll show you how to diffuse the bomb, if you just give me your heart.

VERSE 4:
What's that?
You say you had some feelings hid away.
I can handle this today.
I may be the man, you are mine, so just give me your arm.

CHORUS:
And don't bother to question, the thing you already know...
Like I love you so


VERSE 5:
Screw you!
If you want to be with that dude in the grass skirt
Oh feeling won't be hurt
Your still deep beneath the dirt, guess I won't have your heart.

B         A#m      G#m     F#m      C#m                F#           B
Could've  promised you the moon and stars, if you just give me your heart.
