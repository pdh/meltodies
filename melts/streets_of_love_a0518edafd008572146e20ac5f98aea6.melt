The Rolling Stones - Streets of love

INTRO: C - G - Em - F

C - G - Em - F
Your awful bright,
Your awful smart
I must admit
You broke my heart

C - G - Em - F
The awful truth
Is really sad
I must admit
I was awful bad

C - G - Am - G
While lovers laughed
And music plays
I stumbled by
And hide my pain

F - G - F - G
Umm the lamps are lit
The moon is gone
I think i've crossed the rubicon


Chorus:

C - G - Am - F
Ahh ahhaahha ahha ahhhhaaaa
Walked the streets of love
And they are full of tears

C - G - Am - F
Ahha ahaha ahaha ahaha
Walked the streets of love
And they are full of tears

Verse:
C - G - Em - F
Why music pokes
From passing cars
A couple watched,
Me from above

C - G - Em - F
A band just played
The wedding march
And the cornerstone
Mends broken hearts

C - G - Am - G
The woman ends
If for her debts
Ohh, its free of charge
Just one more chance


Chorus:

C - G - Am - F
Ahha ahaha ahaha ahaha
Walked the streets of love
And they are full of tears

C - G - Am - F
Ahha ahaha ahaha ahaha
Walked the streets of love
For a thousand years

Ohh...

C - G - Em - F
You had the moves
You had the cards
I must admit
You were awful smart

C - G - Em - F
The awful truth
Is awful sad
I must admit
I was awful bad


Chorus:

C - G - Am - F
Aahha ahaha ahahaaa ahhhaa
I walked the streets of love
For a thousand years

C - G - Am - F
Aahha ahaha ahahaaa ahhhaa
Walked the streets of love
And they are drenched in tears
