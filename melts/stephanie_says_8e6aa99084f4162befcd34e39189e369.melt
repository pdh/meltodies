C Em Am G

C Em        Am   F
  Stephanie says
C    Em           Am   F
That she wants to know
C         Em    Am
Why she's given half her life
Dm                  G
To people she hates now

C Em        Am   F
  Stephanie says
C    Em            Am    F
When answering the phone,
C    Em              Am
What country shall I say is calling
Dm              G
From across the world?

    C          F
But she's not afraid to die
    C               F
The people all call her Alaska
C                      F
Between worlds, so the people ask her
       C        F  C   G
'Cause it's all in her mind
C        F  C   G
It's all in her mind

C Em Am G
C Em Am G

C Em        Am   F
  Stephanie says
C    Em           Am   F
That she wants to know
C      Em         Am
Why it is, though she's the door,
Dm               G
She can't be the room

C Em        Am   F
  Stephanie says
C           Em          Am    F
But doesn't hang up the phone
C    Em        Am
What sea shell she is calling
Dm              G
From across the world

    C          F
But she's not afraid to die
    C               F
The people all call her Alaska
C                      F
Between worlds, so the people ask her
       C        F  C   G
'Cause it's all in her mind
C        F  C   G
It's all in her mind

Dm              G             C Em Am C
They're asking, is it good or bad?
Dm           G
It's such an icy feeling
C            F
It's so cold in Alaska
C            F
It's so cold in Alaska
C            F
It's so cold in Alaska

C Em Am G C
