Georgia On My Mind

[G] Georgia, [B7] Georgia, [Em7] the [D7] whole day [C] through [Cm]
Just an [G] old sweet [E7] song keeps [A7] Georgia [D7] on my [B7] mind
[E7  A7  D7]

[G] Georgia, [B7] Georgia, [Em7]   A  [D7] song of [C] you [Cm]
Comes [G] sweet and [E7] clear as [A7] moonlight [D7] through the [G] pines
[C  G  B7]

BRIDGE

[Em7] Other [C] arms reach [A5] out to [C]me
[Em7] Other [C] eyes [Em7] smile tender [A7] ly
[Em7] Still in [C] peaceful [G] dreams I [E7] see the
[Am7] road leads back to [D7] you

[G] Georgia, [B7] Georgia, [Em7] no [D7] peace I [C] find [Cm]
Just an [G] old sweet [E7] song keeps [A7] Georgia [D7] on my [G] mind 
[C  G  B7]

Repeat BRIDGE

[G] Georgia, [B7] Georgia, [Em7] no [D7] peace I [C] find [Cm]
Just an [G] old sweet [E7] song keeps [A7] Georgia [D7] on my [B7] mind
[E7  Am7  D7]

Just an [A7] old sweet [D7] song keeps [C] Georgia [Cm] on my [G] mind 
[Cm  G  D7  G]

This is a simplified busking version of the song with the little finger adding 
most all of the expressives. It sings very well, enjoy!
A5 = 002200 or 577000
