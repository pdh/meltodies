Ridin' High

     D                 Am              G
They told us that we'd never reach the tower
               D  A             D 
They said that we would prob'ly not
                       Am                    G
But we row the boat of lightnin' through the sky
        D A            D
You and I we're ridin' high

Chorus:
        G              D
You and I we're ridin' high
                   Bm               E   A
We're ridin' high upon the wings of love
    D                F#m         G    
You even changed the color of my sky
        D A            D
You and I we're ridin' high

There was a time when I did not believe
That love would fly around with me
And other loves may soar and then fall and die
But you and I we're ridin' high

Chorus
