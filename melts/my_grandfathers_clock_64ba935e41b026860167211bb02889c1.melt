Verse 1:
G                D
My grandfather's clock

         G            C
Was too large for the shelf

      G            D             G
So it stood ninety years on the floor

                 D                 G          C
It was taller by half than the the old man himself

          G             D            G
Though it weighed not a pennyweights more


Verse 2:
       G
It was bought on the morn

       C               G
Of the day that he was born

                   A            D
And was always his pleasure and pride

        G      D
But it stopped short

G           C
Never to go again

         G   D    G
When the old man died

Verse 3:
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

Verse 4:
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound

Verse 5:
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

Verse 6:
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come

Verse 7:
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

Verse 8:
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
