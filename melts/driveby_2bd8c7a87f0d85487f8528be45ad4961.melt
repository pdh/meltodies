Driveby - Neil Young
 
It's  a random kind of thing
came upon a delicate flower
I can't believe a machine gun sings
 Driveby
 Driveby,
 Driveby,
 Driveby
 
Well he borrowed his girlfriend's car
went out riding with the boys
now she's gone like a shooting star
Driveby

Now she's gone like a shooting star
trail of dreams tragic trail of fire
now she's gone like a shooting star
Driveby

Well you feel invincible
it's just a part of life
there's a feud going on and you don't know
Driveby
