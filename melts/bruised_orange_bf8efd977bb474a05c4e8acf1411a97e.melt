Bruised Orange
By: John Prine

Capo on 2nd fret



Intro: G  C  G  C


Verse 1:

G
My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley
       C
Like a long ago Sunday when I walked through the alley
     G                           D
On a cold winters morning to the church house
                    G    G7
Just to shovel some snow


Verse 2:

G
I heard sirens on the train tracks, howl naked, gettin nuder
   C
An alter boy had been hit by a local commuter
          G
Just from walking with his back turned
     D                        G    G7
To a train that was coming so slow


Chorus:

        C
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder
           G
Throw your hands in the air and say what does it matter
       D                       C                  G    G7
But it don't do no good to get angry so help me I know
      C
For a heart stained with anger grows weak and grows bitter
    G
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
                D                 C            G
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own chain of sorrow


Verse 3:

G
I've been brought down to zero pulled out and put back there
      C
I sat on a park bench kissed the girl with the black hair
       G                                 D               G     
And my head shouted down to my heart you better look out below


Verse 4:

G
Well it ain't such a long drop don't stammer, don't stutter
         C
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter
          G                         D                   G      G7
You'll be carrying those bruises to remind you wherever you go


Chorus:

        C
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder
           G
Throw your hands in the air and say what does it matter
       D                       C                  G    G7
But it don't do no good to get angry so help me I know
      C
For a heart stained with anger grows weak and grows bitter
    G
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
                D                 C            G
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own chain of sorrow


Repeat Verse 1:

G
My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley
       C

On a cold winters morning to the church house
                    G    G7
Just to shovel some snow

But it don't do no good to get angry so help me I know
      C
For a heart stained with anger grows weak and grows bitter
    G
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
                D                 C            G
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own chain of sorrow
