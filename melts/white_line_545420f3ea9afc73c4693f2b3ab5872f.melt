 White Line

 Intro:
 Em G C G D

 Em G C G

 Bm                   C
 I came to you when I needed a rest

 D                    Em
 You took my love and put it to the test

 Bm                       G
 I saw some things that I never would have guessed

 D                                            G
 Feel like a railroad I pull the whole load behind


 Em                       G
 That old white line is a friend of mine

          C                G D
 And it's good time we bin makin'

 Em                             G
 Right now I'm rollin' down the open road

         C                     G   Em
 And the daylight will soon be breakin'


 I was adrift on a river of pride
 It seemed like such a long easy ride
 You were my raft but i let you slide
 I bin down but I'm comin' back up again

 And I'm rollin' down the open road
 Where the daylight will soon be breakin'
 Right now I'm thinkin' 'bout the things that i know
 But it's good time(s) that we bin makin'

 end on Bm
