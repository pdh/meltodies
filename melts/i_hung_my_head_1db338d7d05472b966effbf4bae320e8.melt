I Hung My Head
By Johnny Cash
Words and music by Sting

From the album American 4: The Man Comes Around 

Intro - C, F handful of times

[C]Early one morning
With [F]time to kill
I [Am]borrowed Jeb's rifle
And [F]sat on the hill
I [C]saw a lone rider
[F]Crossing the plain
I [Am]drew a bead on him
To [F]practice my aim
[Dm]My brother's rifle
Went [G]off in my hand
A shot rang out
[C]Across the land
The [F]horse he kept running
The [Am]rider was dead
I [C]hung my head I [F]hung my head
[C]
[C]I set off running
To [F]wake from the dream
[Am]My brother's rifle
Went [F]into the stream
[C]I kept on running
[F]Into the salt lands
And [Am]that's where they found me
My [F]head in my hands
The [Dm]sheriff he asked me
[G]Why had I run
Then it came to me
Just [C]what I had done
And [F]all for no reason
Just [Am]one piece of lead
I [C]hung my head I [F]hung my head
[C]
[C]Here in the courthouse
The [F]whole town is there
[Am]I see the judge
High [F]up in his chair
"Ex[C]plain to the courtroom
What [F]went through your mind
And [Am]we'll ask the jury
What [F]verdict they find"
I said [Dm]"I felt the power
Of [G]death over life
I orphaned his children
I [C]widowed his wife
I [F]beg their forgiveness
I [Am]wish I was dead"
I [C]hung my head, I [F]hung my head
[C]
[C]Early one morning
With [F]time to kill
[Am]I see the gallows
[F]Up on the hill
And [C]out in the distance
A [F]trick of the brain
I [Am]see a lone rider
[F]Crossing the plain
[Dm]He's come to fetch me
To [G]see what they done
We'll ride together
[C]'Til kingdom come
I [F]pray for God's mercy
For [F]soon I'll be dead
I [C]hung my head, I [F]hung my head
I [C]hung my head, I [F]hung my head
I [C]hung my head, I [F]hung my head
