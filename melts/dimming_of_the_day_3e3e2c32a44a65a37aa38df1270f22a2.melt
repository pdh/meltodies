(Capo to whatever fret suits your vocal range)

Verse 1
C                                        G
This old house is falling down around my ears
F                 C           G
I'm drowning in a river of my tears
C                                        G
When all my will is gone, you hold me sway
F                 C       G      C
I need you at the dimming of the day.

Bridge
G                                 D
Come the night you're only what I want
G                                 D
Come the night you could be my confidant
G        C         F
Ah ah ah ah ah ant ah ah ant

Verse 2
C                                 G
I see you on the streets in company
F                      C                   G
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
C                                        G
Now all the morning birds have wheeled away
F                 C       G      C
I need you at the dimming of the day

Bridge 2
G                                      D
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
G                                    D
You know just where I keep my better side
G        C        F
i  i  i  i  i  i  ide

Verse 3
C                                   G
What days have come to keep us far apart?
F                 C           G
A broken promise or a broken heart
C                                 G
I'm ready for the night we steal away
F                 C       G      C
I need you at the dimming of the day
F                 C       G      C
I need you at the dimming of the day
