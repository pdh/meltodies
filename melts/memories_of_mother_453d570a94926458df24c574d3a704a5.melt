VERSE 1
G                           C            G
On a dark stormy night the angels called mother
                 G                       D
Her love that we shared for such a short while
              G          C               G
She called us around and told us she was leaving
                 G        D           G
Then closing her eyes she went with a smile


CHORUS
G                      C            G
Mother that rests in a lonesome old graveyard
                G                              D
On a hill a far away there's stands her white tomb
                       G       C        G
With the grass covered over it seems so neglected
                        G            D            G
When the spring seasons comes sweet flowers will bloom


VERSE 2
I'll never forget the love mother gave us
As children we'd play around our old home
I know her reward is a mansion in heaven
While her children on earth are scattered and gone


(CHORUS)
