Verse 1:
       E
Oh, hello Mr. Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason
        E
For the thought that I caught that my head is the
   event of the season.
       A                                            E
Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'
         D                        A
I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger
               E
Is putting the tease on.

Verse 2:
      E
I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter
      E
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her.
    A                                            E
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
                 D                          A       E
She said, You're strange, but don't change,   and I let her.

Verse 3:
     E
In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
       E
Stick around while the clown who is sick
   does the trick of disaster
        A                                          E
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster.
      D                          A
Is it strange I should change? I don't know,
              E
Why don't you ask her?
      D                          A           E
Is it strange I should change? I don't know
      D                          A           E
Is it strange I should change? I don't know
