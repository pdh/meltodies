Since I think that Cat Stevens has made some pretty damn good songs 
I figured I would post the chords for this simple yet inspiring tune.  
I am also a fan or Pearl Jam and have seen Vedder play this song 
live before so I will also include his version which is simply a 
whole step deeper (in G instead of A) to compensate for his deeper voice.

The chords to the left (G,D,C, and D2) are Eddie's chords.  To sound 
like Cat Stevens a capo can be placed at the second fret and Eddies 
chords can be played, or the chords to the right (A,E,D, E2) 
can be played with no capo.  

    G    D    C    D2  |   A    E    D    E2
e   3    2    0    0   |   0    0    2    4
B   3    3    1    3   |   2    0    3    5
G   0    2    0    0   |   2    1    2    4
D   0    0    2    4   |   2    2    4    6
A   2    x    3    5   |   0    2    0    0
E   3    x    x    x   |   x    0    x    x

(Same progression through entire song)
A     E   D       E2                A    E  D     E2   
Don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by
A     E    D       E2          A    E      D      E2 
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there 
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead 
And don't be shy, just let your feeling roll on by 
On by, On by, on by, on by, on by on by... 

You know love is better than a song 
Love is where all of us belong 
So don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by 
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there 
You're there 

Don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by 
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there 
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead 
And don't be shy, just let your feeling roll on by 
On by, on by, on by, on by, etc.




I tried to make this as easy to understand as possible. 
 I hope it worked because this song is EXTREMELY EASY 
and is a great songs for beginners.  Enjoy!
