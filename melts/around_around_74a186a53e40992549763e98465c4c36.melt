                   A
Well the joint was jumpin',
                  A
Goin’ 'round and 'round,
                 D
Hey! reelin' and rockin',
             A
What a crazy sound,
                        E7
Well they never stopped rockin'
                   A
Till the moon went down.

                   A
Well it sounded so sweet
                   A
I had to take me a chance,
                 D
I rose out of me seat
               A
Lord, I had to dance,
                  E7
Started moving my feet,
                  A
Yes’n clapping my hands.

Well they never stopped rockin’,
Goin’ 'round and 'round,
Hey! reelin' and rockin',
What a crazy sound,
You know, they never stopped rockin'
Till the moon went down.

Well at twelve o'clock,
The place was packed,
The front doors was locked
The place was packed,
When the police knocked,
Them ol’ doors they flew back.

Well they never stopped rockin’,
Goin’ 'round and 'round,
Hey! reelin' and rockin',
What a crazy sound,
You know, they never stopped rockin'
Till the moon went down.
