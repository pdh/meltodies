Bob Dylan - When The Ship Comes In


 G             	      D           C           G  
Oh the time will come up when the winds will stop
        Em          C             G
And the breeze will cease to be a-breathin
         G                D              C           G           
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
       G           D          G
 The hour that the ship comes in
        D        C            G  
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
         D            C                G
 And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
       D         		C          G                   
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
         G      C    C     D     G
 And the morning will be a-breaking




G             	      D           C           G  
Oh the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
        Em          C             G
And the seagulls will be a-smilin'
         G                D              C           G           
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
       G           D          G
The hour that the ship comes in 
        D        C            G  
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
         D            C                G
Will not be understood as they're spoken
       D         		C          G                   
Oh the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
         G      C    C     D     G
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean



G             	      D           C           G  
A song will lift as the main sail shifts
        Em          C             G
And the boat drifts unto the shoreline
         G                D              C           G           
And the sun will respect every face on the deck
       G           D          G
The hour that the ship comes in
        D        C            G  
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
         D            C                G
For your wearied toes to be a-touchin'
       D         		C          G                   
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
         G      C    C     D     G
That the whole wide world is watchin'



G             	      D           C           G  
Oh the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes 
        Em          C             G
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
         G                D              C           G           
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal 
       G           D          G
And they'll know that it's for real, 
        D        C            G  
The hour that the ship comes in
         D            C                G
And they'll raise their hands ,Sayin' we'll meet all you demands
       D         		C          G                   
But we'll shout from the bow ,Your days are numbered
       D         		C          G                   
And like Pharoah's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide 
         G      C    C     D     G
And like Goliath they'll be conquered
